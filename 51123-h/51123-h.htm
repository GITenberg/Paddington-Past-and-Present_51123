iii</span>PREFACE AND DEDICATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">History</span> is valuable, not merely for
the facts which it records, but in a much higher degree for the
lessons it teaches; for the Future will be benefited by the Past
and the Present, more in proportion to the amount of truth
developed and error eradicated by their teaching, than by the
number of circumstances preserved.</p>
<p>To judge of the facts of history, it is necessary to have the
liberty to know them; but it has often happened that historical
facts have been so discreditable to the actors of the history,
that the facts have been hidden, and fiction put in their place;
and liberty to know has been refused to all, except the few who
were to become participators in the actions.</p>
<p>There may be a few who know the history of Paddington well;
but by far the greater part of those who now live in this parish
have no clear notion of those circumstances which have influenced
its past, and which affect its present condition.&nbsp; That
Paddington has been transformed into a city of palaces, from a
quiet rural village, is known to all; but by what agency that
change has been effected&mdash;how the profits of that change <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>have been
dispensed, and who have the greatest moral, if not legal, right
to the chief share of those profits&mdash;is not so clearly
understood.</p>
<p>In giving utterance to the facts contained in the following
pages, I have argued freely, according to my conscience, on the
effects produced on my own mind by the facts I have recounted;
and I have not failed to shew how the rights of the people have
been invaded, at almost every step, in the various changes which
have occurred in Paddington.&nbsp; It is true that the facts
contained in this Work, have not been collected under the
superintendence of the lords of the soil; neither are they now
published under their patronage.&nbsp; My sketch might have been
more attractive, had the records in the possession of the Bishop
of London and the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, been
consulted; but I had no desire either to be refused the favour of
inspecting them, or to have my hands tied by accepting it.</p>
<p>The Records in the various Public Record Offices are open to
all; and to those Officers of the Rolls&rsquo; Chapel, the Tower,
and Carlton Ride, as well as those at the British Museum, who
kindly assisted me by directing my search for facts relative to
Paddington, my best thanks are due.&nbsp; I am also indebted to
several kind friends for advice and assistance, during the
progress of this Work through the Press.&nbsp; Mr. B. H. Smart,
the well-known English scholar, kindly suggested to me, some time
since, the possibility of the word <i>Paddington</i> being
derived from <i>Padre ing tun</i>, <i>the Father&rsquo;s
town-meadow</i>; and Sir Harry Dent Goring, of Bayswater House,
was so good as to suggest another derivation, <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>which I think
it right to acknowledge in this place.&nbsp; In a note Sir Harry
writes to me on this subject, he says, &ldquo;A Pad is a Sussex
word now in common use for Pack-Horse * * * ings we have in that
county by hundreds.&nbsp; Now, the carriers to the great City may
have lodged, and had meadows for their Pack-Horses here.&nbsp; I
humbly suggest, therefore, may not Paddington mean <i>the Village
at the Pack-Horse Meadows</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to Dr. R. G.
Latham I am indebted for pointing out to me Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s
opinion as the most probable origin of this word.&nbsp; With
these additional remarks I must leave the decision of this
question, of the origin of the name, to those learned linguists
and antiquarians who desire to enter more deeply into the
subject.</p>
<p>I regret not having been able to spend more time, than I have
done, in researches for this Sketch; but I hope my efforts to
discover facts, relative to Paddington, have not been so
fruitless as to render this attempt entirely undeserving the
attention of the inhabitants of this parish.&nbsp; The only
apology I can offer to my readers for the faults in the Work, is,
that the facts were sought out, and the ideas jotted down, in
moments snatched from the performance of more important and more
harassing duties.&nbsp; Should any one wish to know how it ever
entered my head to give my friends and myself so much trouble,
the reason is readily told:</p>
<p>Having lived in Paddington from 1838 to 1847, in perfect
ignorance of its history, I was aroused, like the rest of the
rate-payers, who lived in the parish, in the latter year, to a
consciousness of the existence of some moving Power in the
parish, by a sudden, and to me <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>unaccountable increase in the demand
on my purse.&nbsp; Having seen a considerable diminution in the
number of houses for the poor, and a considerable increase in the
dwellings of the rich, I was very anxious to ascertain the cause
of this call on me for an increase in my contribution to the
parochial burdens.&nbsp; I found that a re-assessment of the
parish had been made; that my rates, and many others, were
increased as much as 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> in the pound on the
former rental; that the assessment was most unequal and unjust;
and that it was not at all required for the purpose for which it
was said to be made.&nbsp; The excuse given for re-assessing the
parish, was, that the county magistrates had raised the
assessment; but I found, on looking into that question, that one
half-penny in the pound per annum, taken on the old assessment,
would have raised the extra sum required by the county.&nbsp; I
came to the conclusion, therefore, that the governing body had
not chosen to give out to the rate-payers the true motives for
their actions; and finding that they had carried out their
resolution in a most unjust manner, I thought I should not be
doing my duty by discontinuing the enquiry at this point: I
proceeded, and the following pages are the result of my
subsequent investigations.</p>
<p>To shew how Paddington has increased, both in population and
wealth, I have subjoined an abstract of the Census Returns since
their first establishment, and some extracts from the Rate-books
since 1838.&nbsp; For the amount of Rental for 1847,-48,-49, I am
indebted to calculations made by Mr. Aveling, the Vestry-Clerk;
but the amounts for those years do not include the assessment <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>for the
empty houses; for which &pound;10,000 per annum may be
added.&nbsp; The enormous increase in the Rental in the year
1847, arose chiefly from the extra sum laid on by the
re-assessment made that year.&nbsp; The sums in the second column
of that table represent the amounts <i>levied</i> by the two
half-yearly rates.</p>

<p>These Tables clearly shew that the simile used by
Canning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pitt is to Addington,<br />
As London is to Paddington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>no
longer retains the force it did, when uttered by that great
statesman.&nbsp; Few, indeed, can now tell where London ends, and
Paddington begins, or define the connecting links which now unite
these once distant places.&nbsp; Paddington, too, is becoming,
year by year, of still greater importance; and at the present
time there are not many who would deny to it, any more than to
any other portion of that undefined place called <i>London</i>,
its just share of the privileges of &ldquo;The City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we reflect on the vast riches which in the process of
time must accrue to the Church from the insignificant gift of the
Boy-King to Nicholas Ridley; and when we contemplate what sums
have been received, and are likely to be received by the present
occupant of the See of London from that &ldquo;little farm in
Paddington,&rdquo; which has been claimed by that See; <span
class="smcap">the Future</span> of Paddington becomes worthy of a
moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>I have deemed it to be my duty to speak freely of the
management of those lands in Paddington, which were claimed for
the performance of certain specific purposes; and the nature and
the amount of that income from those lands, received by the
present Bishop of London and his lay lessees, have been spoken of
with a freedom, which some may not admire.&nbsp; But I need not
fear condemnation, for a former occupant of the See of London,
thus addressed the over-paid bishops of his day; &ldquo;Come off,
ye Bishops; away with your superfluities; yield up your
thousands; be content with hundreds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many changes
have occurred since Dr. Aylmer penned those words; and much
improvement has taken place and is <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>taking place.&nbsp; Why then do we
complain?&nbsp; A ready answer is furnished by one of the most
accomplished statesmen of our time.&nbsp; Mr. Macaulay truthfully
tells us that &ldquo;there is constant improvement, precisely
because there is constant discontent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let not my
readers think, then, I have complained for the sake of
complaining; or that because I speak of actions which are past,
this exposure will have no influence on the future.&nbsp; I can
most conscientiously say, that should a single good result from
what I have written, I shall be amply repaid for any trouble it
may have cost me to collect the materials for this historical
sketch: and in dedicating the following pages to the Inhabitants
of Paddington, I can say with the learned John Strype, &ldquo;In
what I have writ, I have endeavoured invariably to follow the
tract of truth; and have related things as I found
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And like him, too, &ldquo;I may perhaps be
censured for this plain and impartial way of writing; and blamed,
that I have not put some veil or varnish upon some things, and
been wholly silent of others.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;we are not
writing a Panegyric, but a faithful account.&rdquo;</p>

I.<br />
ABBEY LANDS.</h3>
<p>So many fabulous stories are told us relative to the christian
church, that we cannot be surprised to find the history of its
territorial possessions, in any particular spot, mixed up with
legends which have no foundation in fact.</p>
<p>Paddington has its story.&nbsp; We are told even to this day,
<a name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a> that King Edgar gave lands here to the
Monks of Westminster.&nbsp; And considering what Kings did give
to Monks, and also the kind of services rendered by Dunstan and
his friends to this usurper of his brother&rsquo;s crown, it
would not have been very surprising to have found this tale
true.&nbsp; The same account is given by other authorities.&nbsp;
The Rev. Daniel Lysons&mdash;the historian of &ldquo;The Environs
of London,&rdquo;&mdash;says &ldquo;King Edgar gave the Manor of
Paddington to Westminster Abbey.&rdquo; <a
name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a>&nbsp; And a more recent writer, Mr.
Saunders, in his &ldquo;Results of an Inquiry concerning the
situation and extent of Westminster, at various periods,&rdquo;
has supported this assertion in these
words&mdash;&ldquo;According to Dart, Paddington occurs, as an
appendage to the convent of Westminster, in a Charter of King
Edgar.&rdquo; <a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c"
class="citation">[1c]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately for the credit of
this story, the work these authors have referred to does not
sanction it.&nbsp; Dart, indeed, in the very page referred to
both by Lysons <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>and Saunders, states something very different from that,
which he is reported to have said; for he distinctly informs us
it was Dunstan who gave the land at Paddington to the monks of
Westminster. <a name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a></p>
<p>After specifying the gifts of proceeding Kings, and those of
Edgar in particular, Dart says, &ldquo;But to return to
Dunstan.&nbsp; Having thus influenced the King, he goes on with
his own benefactions.&nbsp; And first by his Charter, takes upon
him to confirm some of the gifts of Edgar, then grants many
privileges to this church, exempts it from the jurisdiction of
the Bishop of London and curses all his successors in that see,
and all others who dare to infringe its rights; and lastly
releases it from the payment of the tax called Roomscot, <a
name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a> as Offa, Kenulph, and Edgar had
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop by another charter secures the privileges of the
convent, and settles certain lands for the maintenance of the
monks, viz. &ldquo;Lands at Hendon and Hanwell to the amount of
twenty-eight hides.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at &ldquo;Paddington, in the
county of Middlesex, which grant was confirmed by his own
Charter, and afterwards by King Henry the Eighth, and said to
contain two hides of land.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also granted certain
lands at Merton, Perham, Cowell, Ewell, and
Shepperton&mdash;thirty seven hides in these five places.&nbsp;
All these grants, <i>with the exception of Paddington</i>, Dart
states were confirmed by the Charter of Edward the Confessor.</p>
<p>But this statement of Dart&rsquo;s relative to the grant of
land in Paddington is of no value, excepting that it probably
names the utmost extent of land which the church of Westminster
<i>ever</i> got in Paddington by honest means, since it has been
convincingly proved that &ldquo;the Great Charters&rdquo; both of
Edgar, and Dunstan, are the fabrication of monks who lived long
after the death of the King and Bishop.</p>
<p>The learned Dr. Hickes has shewn that the hand in which these
charters are written, is of a later period than the time when the
grants are supposed to have been made; that the phraseology is
partly Norman; that Edgar&rsquo;s Charter has the mark of a
pendent seal having been attached to it; and that, to the so
called Dunstan&rsquo;s Charter the waxen impression was remaining
when it was examined by him.&nbsp; He tells us that the practice
of attaching pendent seals is Norman; <a name="citation2c"></a><a
href="#footnote2c" class="citation">[2c]</a> and in this opinion
he is supported by Mr. Astle, <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>in a paper printed in the tenth volume
of the Arch&aelig;ologia.&nbsp; Mr. Kemble, in his introduction
to the first volume of the Anglo Saxon charters, p. 101, also
says, &ldquo;The Norman Charters are for the most part granted
under seal; those of the Saxons, never.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although
in the introduction to the second volume, Mr. Kemble states that
as to the authenticity of several charters he does not agree in
the opinion arrived at by Dr. Hickes, yet we perceive on turning
to this charter the fatal asterisk before it, which either
denotes it to be &ldquo;an ascertained forgery, or liable to
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Richard Widmore, for many years librarian to the Dean
and Chapter of Westminster, says, &ldquo;What the privileges were
that either he (Dunstan) granted, or obtained from King Edgar,
for it (the Abbey) is not at this time to be known the Charters
which now remain, both of the one and the other, have been proved
beyond all doubt to be forgeries.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>This being the case, the mis-quotation of Lysons and Saunders
is of very little account, and is corrected here only for the
sake of preserving something like truth in this historical
narrative.</p>
<p>Dart, who appears to have received Dunstan&rsquo;s Charter
without questioning its authenticity, must have been struck by
the omission of any mention of Paddington in the
Confessor&rsquo;s Charter; and he seems to have been persuaded of
the necessity of producing some kingly authority for the
enjoyment of these lands from the time of Dunstan, as he states,
to the dissolution of the convent&mdash;a period of nearly
six-hundred years; for he adds to the sentence, already quoted,
and as though it was an after thought, &ldquo;King Stephen
afterwards confirmed this manor and liberties granted with it,
and after him King Henry the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How these Kings &ldquo;confirmed this manor&rdquo; we are not
told, neither do I know what documents Dart could have seen, to
induce him to make this assertion.&nbsp; In the only Charter of
Stephen&rsquo;s to the Abbey, to be found in the Monasticon,
there is no confirmation of this manor or any mention of
it.&nbsp; Neither is there any Charter of Henry the
Second&rsquo;s to the Abbey to be found in that great work.&nbsp;
If Dart simply intended that these Kings confirmed to the Abbey
all the charters then existing, he is, in all probability, right;
but if he wished it to be understood that there was any special
grant of this manor I think we may fairly dismiss this
unsupported assertion without any further consideration.&nbsp;
And we <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>may
do this the more readily, because Widmore, the most trustworthy
author who has ever written on the Abbey, tells us, that Dart was
much more of a poet than an antiquarian, and that his
&ldquo;pompous work&rdquo; contains errors in almost every
page.</p>
<p>In speaking of the fabricated documents which the Westminster
monks left behind them, Widmore has well said,&mdash;&ldquo;Such
forgery, tho&rsquo; it be an ugly charge against any, whether
single persons or bodies of men, yet the thing, in this case, is
too manifest to be denied or doubted of; and the monks of
Westminster were not alone in such practices; it was a general
Thing, and the Fault of the Times; and it is said, in mitigation
of it, that the Norman Conquerors made it as it were necessary,
by disregarding the Old Saxon Charters of Lands and Privileges,
and reducing the Monks to the hard condition of either losing
what belonged to them, or defending it by forged instruments in
Latin.&nbsp; But when Persons give themselves Leave to defend
even a good Title by undue means, they seldom know where to stop,
and the success at first emboldens them to enlarge beyond all
Reason.&nbsp; And tho&rsquo; I do not think that in this Practice
the whole was Fiction and Invention, they only added what they
imagined would more especially serve their Purpose; yet by this
means they have destroyed the certainty of History and left those
who come after them no better Help, in separating the Truth from
Fables, than conjecture and not altogether improbable
supposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what has been said, it is evident that it will not do to
rely on the authorities above referred to for an account of the
acquisition of the Abbey lands in Paddington.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, there are documents of a very ancient
date on which some reliance can be placed; and thanks to the
enlightened liberality of the Commons of England, and the
untiring industry of those gentlemen engaged by the Record
Commissioners, many of these documents have been made readily
available for the uses of the public. <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>One of
the Saxon Chroniclers is reported to have said, the survey, taken
by order of William the Conqueror, was so accurate &ldquo;that
not a hide or yardland, not an ox, cow, or hog, was omitted in
the census.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although we may not be able to
believe that the Conqueror&rsquo;s scrutiny was thus minute, yet
the Dom Boc, or Domesday Book, has been always looked upon as a
document worthy of much confidence.&nbsp; The inquisitors were
appointed to enquire &ldquo;Upon the oath of the sheriffs, the
lords of each manor, the presbyters of every church, the reves of
every hundred, the bailiffs and six villains of every village,
into the name of the place, who held it in the time of King
Edward, who was the present possessor, how many hides in the
manor, &amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo; <a name="citation5a"></a><a
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a></p>
<p>If these directions were carried out, and faithfully entered,
we should expect to find some account in this document of the
Abbey possessions in Paddington, if any such existed at the time
this survey was taken.&nbsp; But Mr. Saunders is perfectly
correct in stating that no mention is made either of this place,
or of Westbourn, or Knightsbridge, in the Domesday Book.</p>
<p>In the hundred of Osulvestane (Ossulston) the King held twelve
acres and a half of land, worth five shillings, claimed by no
one.&nbsp; He had also in this hundred &ldquo;thirty cottagers
who pay fourteen shillings and ten pence and one half-penny a
year;&rdquo; and two other cottagers belonging to Holburne paying
&ldquo;twenty-pence a year to the King&rsquo;s Sheriff.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the village where the Church of St. Peter is
situated,&rdquo; there were at the time of this survey, forty-one
cottagers who paid forty shillings to the Convent for their
gardens.&nbsp; And the land in and around the village of
Westminster which belonged to the Abbey amounted in all to
thirteen hides and a half; valued at eight pounds per
annum.&nbsp; The whole in King Edward&rsquo;s time twelve pounds.
<a name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a></p>
<p>The manor of Kensington answered for ten hides; and was held
by Aubrey de Ver.&nbsp; Lilestone answered for five hides;
Tybourn for five hides; Willesden for fifteen, with pannage for
five hundred hogs; and Chelsea <a name="citation5d"></a><a
href="#footnote5d" class="citation">[5d]</a> and Hampstead are
duly accounted for.&nbsp; But Paddington in Middlesex is not <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>named.&nbsp; A
manor of &ldquo;Padendene&rdquo; existed at this time, and is
mentioned in the survey, but it was situated in the county of
Surrey; and singularly enough was shortly after held by the same
family&mdash;the De Veres&mdash;who held Kensington, and who
afterwards, also, held Tybourn.</p>
<p>Were there, then, no dwellings, no cultivated lands in
Middlesex known by the name of Paddington, in 1086&mdash;the date
of the Conqueror&rsquo;s survey?&nbsp; Was Paddington at this
period an uncultivated portion of the great Middlesex Forest; or
did a few of the King&rsquo;s cottagers live here, unnoticed and
unknown, before this scrutiny discovered them?&nbsp; Were the
broad acres, subsequently claimed by the monks of Westminster,
accounted for in the territories of the neighbouring lords; or
did they form but a portion of the home domain of the
Convent?&nbsp; Was the village, and the land, known by any other
name?</p>
<p>Of all these possible suppositions, which is the most
probable?</p>
<p>To enter fully into a discussion of these questions would
require a greater amount of antiquarian knowledge than I possess;
and would occupy more space in this work than I can spare.&nbsp;
To obtain an answer to the last question satisfactory to my own
mind, it is true I have made some researches, and I will, as
concisely as possible, convey to my readers the opinions at which
I have arrived; detailing in this place only so many of the
topographical facts as may be necessary to shew upon what
foundations those opinions have been formed.</p>
<p>We know, from Fitz Stephen, that an immense forest,
&ldquo;beautified with wood and groves,&rdquo; but &ldquo;full of
the lairs and coverts of beasts and game, stags, bucks, boars,
and wild bulls,&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> existed even in the
twelfth century at no great distance from what then constituted
London.&nbsp; Small portions only of this forest appear to have
been, at any time, the property of the crown.&nbsp; It formed a
part of the public land which was entrusted to the charge of the
elected governors of the people.&nbsp; In it the citizens had
free right of chase, preserved by many royal charters: it was
disafforested by Henry the third in 1218. <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; And during the Saxon period it
would have been no difficult matter to have obtained a settlement
even in the most desirable parts of it.&nbsp; To shew the extent
of this forest in Middlesex, and the paucity of fixed inhabitants
in it, when for the purposes of government, families arranged
themselves into tens, and hundreds, we have only to remember <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that the
Hundred of Ossulston occupied nearly half the county; although it
included both London and Westminster.</p>
<p>The Fleete, the Tybourn, and the Brent, were the three notable
streams which carried the waters from the hills north of the
Thames through this forest to the great recipient of them
all.&nbsp; And it is probable that the Saxons early settled on
the elevated banks of these streams, finding there a more
healthful and safer retreat than could be found on the banks of
&ldquo;the silent highway&rdquo; which was so frequently
traversed by the Danes.</p>
<p>Another powerful inducement existed in this locality to fix
the wandering footsteps of the emigrant.&nbsp; Two roads made
through the forest by the skill of the previous conquerors of the
country, united in this spot; and remained to show the
uncultivated Saxon, what genius and perseverance could
effect.&nbsp; These having served the purpose of a military way
to conduct the Roman Legions from south to north, and from east
to west, were now ready to be used in aid of civilized
life.&nbsp; And it is scarcely conceivable that a spot so
desirable could have remained long unoccupied by the seekers of a
home.</p>
<p>This locality is the present site of Paddington by whatever
name it was then called.&nbsp; And it was, in all probability, at
a very early period of our history occupied by the Saxon
settler.</p>
<p>The question whether those who settled here were conveyed with
the soil to some spiritual, or temporal, lord, previous to, or
immediately subsequent to, the Norman conquest, cannot be so
satisfactorily determined.&nbsp; Traditions are at variance;
documents are not trustworthy; and names have been altered; so
that two opinions may be entertained about the things described
even in the instruments which exist.&nbsp; There is, however, one
general rule which will assist us in coming to a correct decision
as to the boundaries we find laid down.</p>
<p>When the science of making and interpreting artificial signs
had acquired all the potency of a black art; when the acquisition
of this art was strictly guarded by all the rules of a craft; and
when this art was used to describe a title to lands, and to
define the extent of those lands, it still remained necessary,
for the safety of those who held this <i>book-land</i>, that the
natural signs should be used, if any knowledge of these things
was to be preserved by the people, who were carefully excluded
from any dealings with so subtile an agency as the lawyer&rsquo;s
quill.&nbsp; And I think we may safely conclude that the most
prominent and permanent objects, natural or artificial, would be
invariably chosen to point out the bounds of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>original
settlement, when the time had come to render land marks
necessary.</p>
<p>We might expect, therefore, to find that the Westminster
monks, in carving out for themselves a comfortable and compact
estate, would choose for its boundaries the most prominent and
permanent objects in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; And in
Edgar&rsquo;s first Charter&mdash;<i>that dated six years before
Edgar was King</i>&mdash;we do find, with some additions, the
Thames chosen for the southern boundary; the Roman road for the
northern; the Fleete for the eastern; and the Tybourn for the
western.&nbsp; And if we take the largest stream between the
Fleete and the Brent to have been the Tybourn, we can readily
explain how the convent claimed a manor in Chelsea; and we can
clearly understand, too, how the Norman monks read this Saxon
Charter so as to make it include the manor of Paddington&mdash;as
that portion of land, bounded by the Roman roads, and the bourn,
was at one time called.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders, in his &ldquo;Inquiry, &amp;c.&rdquo; has come
to the conclusion that the <i>ancient</i> Tybourn was the stream
which has been <i>recently</i> known by that name.&nbsp; But I
think those who will take the trouble to examine this subject
thoroughly will come to the conclusion that on this point that
inquirer has been deceived.</p>
<p>It is evident the facts which came under Mr. Saunders&rsquo;s
notice, in the course of his inquiry, did not entirely square
with the supposition which he has adopted.&nbsp; And after all,
he is obliged to admit that Westminster extended, and extends, to
the stream farther westward than the one he has accepted as its
western boundary.&nbsp; This West-bourn, or brook, I take to be
the ancient Tybourn&mdash;the western boundary of the district
described in the charter, dated 951; and the western boundary of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish, as defined by the Ecclesiastical
Decree of 1222.&nbsp; Lysons, writing at the end of the last
century, described the stream which crossed the Tybourn road, now
Oxford-street, as a &ldquo;small bourn, or rivulet
<i>formerly</i> called Aye-brook or Eye-brook, and <i>now</i>
Tybourn-brook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the maps of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries we find but <i>one</i> stream delineated as descending
from the high ground about Hampstead.&nbsp; In Christopher
Saxton&rsquo;s curious map of 1579; in Speede&rsquo;s beautiful
little map of 1610; in John Seller&rsquo;s, of 1733; in
Morden&rsquo;s; in Seales&rsquo;s; in Rocque&rsquo;s accurate
surveys; and in others of less note; we see this stream takes the
course of that brook which <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was at one time called Westbourn, and
which I believe was anciently called the Tybourn, and discharges
itself into the Thames at Chelsea.&nbsp; The Eye brook on the
other hand scarcely appeared before it came to the conduits built
by the citizens of London; it then crossed Oxford-street in the
valley west of Stratford-place, and emptied itself into a
reservoir at the north-eastern corner of &ldquo;The Deer
Park,&rdquo; or as it is now called &ldquo;The Green
Park.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appears to have been originally very little
larger than the Tychbourn which ran down the Edgeware-road; the
former carrying the waters from the southern side of
Primrose-hill, the latter from the south of Maida-hill.&nbsp; The
Eyebourn, however, was very much increased in size when the
superabundant supply from the conduits, which were fed by the
water brought from Tybourn, and from springs near the village of
Eye, were emptied into it.&nbsp; When the reservoir in the Green
Park was enclosed with brick and supplied by the Chelsea
Water-works Company from the Thames, this brook was covered in,
carried beneath the old reservoir, and converted into a sewer,
and is now known by the name of the King&rsquo;s Scholars Pond
Sewer; while the larger stream to the west, the Tybourn or
Westbourn, has degenerated into the Ranelagh Sewer.</p>
<p>There is another fact also worthy of note: Holinshed, when
speaking of the execution of the Earl of March, which took place
in the reign of Edward the third, says, that in those days the
place of execution was called &ldquo;The Elmes,&rdquo; but was
known in his day by the name of &ldquo;Tiborne.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
the present time enough of &ldquo;Elms-lane&rdquo; <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> remains, at Bayswater, to point out
where the fatal Elm grew, and the gentle &ldquo;Tiborne&rdquo;
ran.</p>
<p>Dr. Stukeley, and other learned antiquarians, are of opinion
that the Edgeware-road, and the Uxbridge-road, represent, very
nearly, the sites of the ancient Roman roads.&nbsp; Now if the
Tybourn was, in truth, the same stream as the Westbourn, the
monks of Westminster had only to follow its course from the
Thames till they came to the <i>second</i> &ldquo;broad military
road&rdquo; which crossed it, instead of stopping at the
<i>first</i> they met with, (<i>and the charter says nothing
about the first or second</i>), and in their ascent up this
stream, and descent by the <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>road, they would have included not
only their Manor of Chelsea, but the Manor of Paddington also. <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a></p>
<p>And if this reading of Edgar&rsquo;s Charter was objected to
by the Great Chamberlain of England, or any other powerful
neighbouring lord, there was Edward&rsquo;s Charter for Chelsea;
<a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> and Dunstan&rsquo;s for Paddington in
reserve.</p>
<p>But the exact time when the words &ldquo;Et illud praediolum
in Padingtune aecclesiae pradictae addidi,&rdquo; <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a> first formed a portion of that
&ldquo;forged instrument in Latin&rdquo; called Dunstan&rsquo;s
Charter; or when those who cultivated the soil in this
neighbourhood had to adopt their new lord, and transfer their
services from the palace to the convent, does not very plainly
appear.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, &ldquo;a little farm in
Padintun&rdquo; became every year, after the Conqueror&rsquo;s
survey, more and more desirable.</p>
<p>These forged charters, as we shall presently see, could <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>not, of
themselves, secure the monks of Westminster their Paddington
estate; and another expedient had to be resorted to.</p>
<p>I have just now assumed that the inhabitants of Paddington
were free settlers, or King&rsquo;s cottagers.&nbsp; And although
this was undoubtedly the case at first, yet by the time of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s survey they may have been under the
<i>protection</i> of some mean lord.&nbsp; And I believe the
manor of Paddington subsequently created by the monks of
Westminster, was at this time a portion of the manor of
Tybourn.&nbsp; For besides the evidence already produced, to shew
that Tybourn and Westbourn were synonymous terms; we find in a
legal document, even so late as 1734, that &ldquo;two messuages
and six acres of land lying in the common field of
Westboune,&rdquo; and three other acres, also in the same common
field, are described as being &ldquo;parcel of the manor of
Tyburn, and called Byard&rsquo;s Watering Place.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>If, then, the districts now called Westbourn and Paddington,
were included in the manor of Tybourn in the Conqueror&rsquo;s
survey, it is very evident that a rearrangement, both of these
districts and the neighbouring manors, must have taken place when
the Westminster monks established their claim to
Paddington.&nbsp; And it is not improbable that the lords of
Chelsea, Kensington, and Tybourn, insisted upon maintaining, for
themselves and their tenants, commonable rights over the
Westbourn district.</p>
<p>How the monks of Westminster, in the course of time, became
both spiritual and temporal masters of the Westbourn district,
can be readily conceived by those who know anything of the power
engendered by the concentration of all knowledge into a few
bodies, especially if those bodies have a perpetual
existence.</p>
<p>As I have before said, the monks found that their forged
charters would not sufficiently serve them legally to inherit
Paddington.&nbsp; They were obliged therefore to purchase the
interest in the soil from at least one of the families whose
ancestors had made it valuable.&nbsp; This appears from a
document which I have translated below, and which is to be found
in Maddox&rsquo;s Formulare Anglicanum, page 217, and which as
appears by a note, at the foot of it, this learned and
indefatigable <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>antiquary discovered in the archives of the Dean and
Chapter of Westminster.&nbsp; The document is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A final Concord of Land between the Abbot
of Westminster and Richard and William de Padinton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the final agreement made in the Court of the
Lord King at Westminster, on the Friday next after the ascension
of our Lord, in the thirty-first year of the reign of King Henry
the second, before J. Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Granville the
Lord King&rsquo;s Justiciaries, and Richard the Treasurer, and
Godfrey de Lucie, and Hubert Walter, and William Basset, and
Nigel son of Alexander, and other faithful lieges of the King
being then and there present; between Walter Abbot of
Westminster, and Richard and William of Padinton, brothers,
touching the entire tenement which they held in Padinton, of the
Church of Westminster.&nbsp; Whereupon it was pleaded between
them in the Court of the Lord King, namely, that the aforesaid
Richard and William have quit-claimed (given up) for ever, for
themselves and all their successors and heirs, all and the
aforesaid tenement, and whatever right they had therein, without
any reserve, to the aforesaid Church of Westminster and the
Abbot, and have restored to him the land with all its
appurtenances: and for this resignation, the Abbot aforesaid hath
given to them forty marks of silver and four allowances or
maintenances, &ldquo;conredi&aelig;,&rdquo; in the Church of
Westminster, two of which are for the service of the aforesaid
Richard and William for the twelve following years, and the other
two are for the service of the wives of the aforesaid Richard and
William, together with gratuities, &ldquo;caritatibus,&rdquo; and
pittances so long as the same women shall live.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maddox adds that this document &ldquo;has at the top, the
letters, Chiographum, very large ones, cut through
indent-wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are not informed by this instrument what was &ldquo;the
extent of the entire tenement,&rdquo; thus sold to the Abbot of
Westminster.&nbsp; But it will be observed, that the land
purchased of Richard and William is said to have been held by
them &ldquo;of the Church of Westminster.&rdquo;&nbsp; From which
we might imagine, that the lordship of the soil, had been already
legally appropriated to St. Peter, did we not know that it is
equally probable, that one of the tricks of the time had been
played off, to lessen the risk of the purchased land being
forfeited to the Crown.</p>
<p>Blackstone tells us that when a tenant&mdash;and all were
tenants now, either of the King, or some other lord,&mdash;wished
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to
alienate his lands to a religious house, he first conveyed them
to the house, and instantly took them back again, &ldquo;to hold
as tenant to the monastery.&rdquo;&nbsp; This instantaneous
seisin, he further informs us, did not occasion forfeiture: and,
this fact being accomplished, &ldquo;by pretext of some other
forfeiture, surrender, or escheat, the society entered into those
lands in right of such their newly acquired signiory, as
immediate lords of the fee.&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>Other documents, shewing the acquisition by the Convent of
other lands in this place and Westbourn, at a later period, will
be produced in the next chapter; but this is the only one dated
before the end of the twelfth century, having any appearance of
authenticity, which I have been able to discover relative to the
Abbey lands in Paddington.</p>
<p>The Abbot who purchased the interest of the brothers of
Paddington, in the Paddington soil, is called Walter of
Winchester, to distinguish him from another Walter, called of
Wenlock, who was also an Abbot of Westminster, but a century
after this time.&nbsp; Of him also we shall have to speak in the
next chapter in connexion with the further extension of the Abbey
lands in Paddington.</p>
<p>Walter, the first, directed that the anniversary of the day on
which he died should be kept as a feast day at the Convent: and
we are told that he gave the manor of Paddington for its proper
celebration.&nbsp; And as this story will well serve to
illustrate the manner in which much of the property of the church
was spent in those days, and, perhaps, serve also to shew how the
neighbouring proprietors were quieted for the transfer of the
lordship to this Abbot, I shall reproduce it as it was given to
the Arch&aelig;ological Society, on the third of May, 1804, by
Dr. Vincent, a former Dean of Westminster.</p>
<p>The Dean states that the account he read was taken from an
ancient MS. preserved in the archives of the Dean and
Chapter.&nbsp; The following is the Dean&rsquo;s own translation
of the manuscript in question:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Walter, Abbot of Westminster, died the
twenty-seventh of September, in the second year of King Richard
the first, and in the year of our Lord, 1191.</p>
<p>The manor of Paddington was assigned for the celebration of
his anniversary, in a solemn manner, under this form.</p>
<p>On the fifth of the Kalends of October (that is on the
twenty-seventh of September), on the festival of Saint Cosmas <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and Saint
Damian, the anniversary of Walter, the Abbot, is to be
celebrated; and for the celebration, the manor of Paddington is
put wholly in the hands of the Almoner, for the time being, and
entrusted to his discretion; and this he is faithfully to
observe, that whatsoever shall be the final overplus is to be
expended charitably in distribution to the poor.</p>
<p>On the day of the celebration, the Almoner is to find for the
Convent, fine manchets, cakes, crumpets, cracknells, and wafers,
and a gallon of wine for each friar, with three good pittances,
or doles, with good ale in abundance at every table, and in the
presence of the whole brotherhood; in the same manner as upon
other occasions the cellarer is bound to find beer at the usual
feasts or anniversaries, in the great tankard of twenty-five
quarts. <a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>He shall also provide most honourably, and in all abundance,
for the guests that dine in the refectory, bread, wine, beer, and
two dishes out of the kitchen, besides the usual allowance.&nbsp;
And for the guests of higher rank, who sit at the upper table
under the bell, with the president, ample provision shall be made
as well as for the Convent; <i>and cheese shall be served on that
day to both</i>. <a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a></p>
<p>Agreement shall likewise be made with the cook, for vessels,
utensils, and other necessaries, and not less than two shillings
shall be given over above, for his own gratification and
indulgence.</p>
<p>The Almoner is likewise to find for all comers in general,
from the hour when the memorial of the anniversary is read to the
end of the following day, meat, drink, hay, and provender of all
sorts, in abundance; and no one either on foot or on horseback
during that time shall be denied admittance at the gate.</p>
<p>He shall also make allowance to the Nuns at Kilburne, both
bread and wine, as well as provisions from the kitchen, supplied
on other days by the cellarer and the cook: neither shall the
Nuns lose their ordinary allowance, on account of the
extraordinary.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>But the
servants of the court, who are at other times accustomed to have
wine and flagons, and all those who have billets upon the
cellarer for allowances, shall receive wine and bread only from
the Almoner on this day, and not from the cellarer; they shall
likewise have a pittance from him.</p>
<p>But those who have a pittance from Bemfleete at other times,
and three hundred poor besides, shall have a refection on this
day, that is to say, a loaf of the weight of the Convent loaf,
made of mixed corn, and each of them that pleases a pottle of
ale; and those who have not vessels for this purpose shall take a
draught at pleasure, and two dishes from the kitchen suitable to
the hospitality of the day.</p>
<p>The Almoner, moreover, besides these doles, pittances, and
allowances, <i>shall find bread at command</i>, but not wine, and
therefore those who have the command never allow wine, though
they admit military men with their swords on. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>He is likewise bound to find bread of mixed corn, by his
office, to each of the servants, but not beer; neither is he
bound to find beer for the Convent to drink after vespers, unless
he chooses it as a special favour; neither does he usually find
the collations.</p>
<p>But without all doubt, the president with his guests in the
refectory, have a right to wine and beer in abundance after their
refection, and the Almoner shall likewise allow mead to the
Convent for the cup of charity, the loving cup.</p>
<p>The Almoner, also, who is not accustomed to brew in large
quantities more than four times a year, shall take especial care
to provide five casks of the best beer for this anniversary.</p>
<p>Afterwards, however, a modification was made of this
anniversary in this form: namely, that every year (on the
festival of the Saints aforesaid), the Prior and the convent
shall sing <i>the placebo</i> and <i>dirige</i> with three
lessons, as is usual on other anniversaries, and with the chiming
(or a peal) of bells.&nbsp; That two wax candles shall be kept
burning at the tomb of Walter, from the vigil of the anniversary
to the end of the requiem mass the following day, which the prior
or any head of the order present shall sing; and on that day the
Almoner, for the time being, shall distribute two quarters of
corn in baked bread to the poor, according to the usuage of the
Convent; but there shall be no distribution of other things, or
dispensation of alms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Whether
the song of the monks really pleased the people as much as the
cakes and ale we are not told, but considering the present use of
the word <i>placebo</i>, we may doubt it.&nbsp; We are not
informed either, when this <i>modification</i> was made; but the
Dean tells us that the retrenchment was very necessary, for the
convent stood in some danger of being ruined by anniversaries;
almost every Abbot having one.</p>
<p>Widmore, who mentions this anniversary, tells us Dr. Patrick,
the editor of Gunton&rsquo;s History of Peterborough, got his
account from John Flete, the Monkish Historian of Westminster,
who died in the Convent in 1464, having completed its history,
which he wrote at the request of the monks, down to 1386.</p>
<p>Of John Flete, Widmore says, in his account of the writers of
the History of Westminster Abbey, &ldquo;He sets down his
authorities as he found them; but as criticism was not a study in
request in his time, he neither doth, nor was, I suppose, able to
distinguish what in antiquity was true and genuine from
forgeries.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>Of Walter of Winchester, the same learned writer remarks
&ldquo;There is little account left what this man did while Abbot
here: he seems to have been too easy in granting out the estates
of the church in fee farm: the manor of Denham in Bucks, the
tithes of Boleby in Lincolnshire, the Church of St. Alban in
Wood-street, what the Abbey had in Staining-lane and
Friday-street, and the manor of Paglesham in Essex, were so
granted by him.&nbsp; He seems to have been solicitous to
perpetuate his memory by an anniversary, having ordered a very
pompous one, much beyond those of any of his predecessors, and
got the profits of the manor of Paddington assigned for that
purpose: but this, sometime after, being thought too great, was
very much lowered, and only loaves made of two quarters of wheat
were on that day given to the poor, by the Almoner of the
Abbey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard de Croksley, who died in 1258, was still more liberal
with the funds he could no longer use, for he assigned the whole
produce of the manors of Hamstead and Stoke for the celebration
of his death-day.&nbsp; The ringers were paid thirteen shillings
and four-pence for ringing the bells on the eve of the
anniversary; one thousand poor were to receive a penny each on
the first day; and for six subsequent days, five hundred were to
receive daily one penny, for which sixteen <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>pounds,
thirteen shillings and four-pence was assigned; while for the
arduous duties enjoined on the monks&mdash;&ldquo;for the repose
of the Abbot&rsquo;s soul, four monks were to celebrate mass at
four different altars every day for ever,&rdquo; only
twenty-seven pounds was given.&nbsp; But in less than ten years
after this Abbot&rsquo;s death &ldquo;<i>the burthen of
commemorating him in the way he had ordained was found too heavy
to be borne</i>;&rdquo; and after petitioning the Pope on this
subject, and receiving his mandate thereon, this anniversary was
modified and ten marks was assigned for keeping it. <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>From the Taxatio Ecclesiastica, made under the authority of
Pope Nicholas the fourth, and published by the Record
Commissioners, we learn that a century after the death of Walter,
the whole of the temporalities of Paddington were devoted to the
purposes of charity; that they arose from the rent of land, and
the young of animals, and were valued at eight pounds, sixteen
shillings and four-pence.&nbsp; And the same valuable work
informs us of a chapel built and endowed in this place, at the
time this survey was taken.</p>
<p>In the preface to this work the following account of this
taxation is given&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the year 1288, Pope Nicholas the fourth,
granted the tenths of all Ecclesiastical benefices to King Edward
the first, for six years, towards defraying the expense of an
expedition to the Holy Land; and that they might be collected to
their full value, a taxation by the King&rsquo;s Precept was
begun in that year (1288) and finished as to the Province of
Canterbury in 1291, and as to that of York in the following year;
the whole being under the direction of John, Bishop of Winton,
and Oliver, Bishop of Lincoln.</p>
<p>The taxation of Pope Nicholas is a most important Record,
because all the taxes, as well to our Kings as the Popes, were
regulated by it until the survey made in the twenty-sixth year of
Henry the eighth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the twelfth and early part of the thirteenth centuries,
disputes of a very unseemly nature frequently took place between
the Abbots of Westminster and the Bishops of London, relative to
the jurisdiction of the latter over the Abbey, and otherwise as
to their respective privileges and districts.&nbsp; Another
pretty good proof, as Widmore justly remarks, that the ancient
charters, so much spoken of, were mere forgeries.&nbsp; These
disputes were at length referred to Stephen Langton, Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Bishops of Winchester <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and
Salisbury, and the Priors of Merton and Dunstaple; and in their
decree, which is published at length in Wharton&rsquo;s Historia
de Espiscopis et Decanis Londinensibus, after giving the Bishop a
considerable slice of the territory which the monks had claimed
in the region of the Fleete, and fixing the boundary westward, as
in Edgar&rsquo;s Charter, by the Tybourn, the following passage
occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;Extra ver&oacute; supr&aacute; scriptas
metas vill&aelig; de Knygtebrigge, Westburne, Padyngtoun cum
Capell&acirc;, et cum earum pertinentiis, pertinent ad Parochiam
S. Margaret&aelig; memoratum.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; So that even
the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Paddington had not been
legally given to the Abbey before the thirteenth century; for
this document is dated 1222.</p>
<p>If we can rely on the authenticity of the passage just quoted,
a chapel must have been built here previous to that date; and now
this chapel, as the author of the Ecclesiastical Topography
correctly remarks became a Chapel of Ease to St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster.&nbsp; This writer makes the value
of the church and chapel, in 1291, only thirty marks and a half;
<a name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a> but in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica,
printed by the Record Commission, the following entries are to be
found at page 17:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>&ldquo;Ecclia Sce Margarete cu Capella de Padinton</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">&pound;20.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Vicaria Ejusdem</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">8.&rdquo;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>No inconsiderable difference in times when the land in
Paddington paid only four-pence per acre, per annum, rent.</p>
<p>Whatever doubts may arise in the mind as to the accuracy of
John Flete&rsquo;s story, or as to the capability of the land in
Paddington to furnish the annual feast we have described as
having been appointed in 1191; it appears from this taxation,
that in 1291, a chapel was built and endowed here; and the sum we
have already mentioned given in charity.</p>
<p>The temporal entry in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica is as
follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>&ldquo;Bona Obedienc&rsquo; Westm&rsquo; in Westmon&rsquo;
Elemosinar&rsquo; be redd&rsquo;</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">&pound;1</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">12</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">3</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Item idem in Padinton de terr&rsquo; redd&rsquo;

</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">8</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">16</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">4&rdquo;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This &ldquo;rent of land&rdquo; was derived from those lands
which <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>had
been purchased by Walter; those which the Walter, who makes this
return, had himself obtained; and all those over which the
Convent had acquired manorial rights.&nbsp; And I presume any
other small tithe was included in this elemosinary item with
&ldquo;the young of animals.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great tithe and the
rent of the glebe land being accounted for in the spiritual part
of the valuation.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
THE MANORS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
WESTBOURN AND PADDINGTON.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we accept the definition of the
word manor given by the learned Judge Blackstone, in his
Commentaries on the Laws of England, <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> or look upon a manor
to be &ldquo;the subinfeudation of a particular district made by
A to B,&rdquo; I think we must come to the conclusion, that
neither Westbourn nor Paddington, in ancient times, were manors
in either of these senses, unless indeed we consider Westbourn
and Tybourn synonymous terms, for we find no account of any
lordly residence in either of these places till many centuries
after the Conqueror&rsquo;s survey; neither is there any account,
which can be relied on, to establish the fact of any King having
granted these districts to the Abbot and Monks of Westminster; or
of the Abbot&rsquo;s subinfeudation of them.&nbsp; And if we do
not consider these places a portion of the Tybourn manor, it is
pretty certain that the cottagers who cultivated the land in this
neighbourhood were not only freemen, but freeholders, even at the
time of the Conquest.&nbsp; They could have owned no other lord
but the King, and the suit and service they would have rendered
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>him
differed but little from that exacted of the most powerful lord
in the land.&nbsp; Each paid his tax according to his
circumstances.&nbsp; But many new manors were created after the
conquest, and an Act of Parliament, the 18th of Edward I, 1290,
was passed to put a stop to this practice.</p>
<p>It was no uncommon thing, for Religious Houses, when they had
obtained a few acres of land in any place, to elevate them to the
dignity of a manor, and assume on their general licence, manorial
rights over the district in which their newly acquired property
lay. <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a></p>
<p>Moreover, to secure the assistance of the monks, the early
Norman Kings were frequently obliged to connive at practices of
which they could not approve, but which they dared not
condemn.&nbsp; And when the monks of Westminster, after casting a
longing eye on the lands of Paddington, produced the charters
which they called Edgar&rsquo;s and Dunstan&rsquo;s, and claimed
the lordship over these outlying districts, the King, who then
happened to require their services, may have thought it mattered
but little, who reaped the benefits derivable from being the lord
of the few tenants in Paddington.&nbsp; And he may have
sanctioned that which was in fact an usurpation.</p>
<p>If, however, Edgar&rsquo;s and Dunstan&rsquo;s Charters were
brought forward for the purpose of shewing some sort of title to
the manor of Paddington, when the first claim to the lordship was
set up, which I think was most likely the case, it is very
evident that the monks themselves had no great faith that these
charters would bear any sort of legal examination, even in those
days, when the wig was adopted to hide the shaven crown. <a

was issued in the twenty-second year of Edward the First to the
then Abbot of Westminster&mdash;Walter of Wenlock&mdash;to
enquire &ldquo;by what authority he claimed to hold the Pleas of
the Crown, to have free warren, a market, a fair, toll, a
gallows, the chattels of persons condemned, and of runaways, the
right of imprisonment,&rdquo; and various other such like
privileges, as well as &ldquo;the appointment of the coroner in

Westburn,&rdquo; besides in the town of Staines, and its
dependencies; he did not claim manorial rights over Paddington
and Westbourn on account of Edgar&rsquo;s, or Dunstan&rsquo;s
grant of these manors; neither did he mention those charters, as
he might have done had they been genuine or had they received the
confirmation of Stephen, or Henry the Second, as Dart states they
did.&nbsp; On the contrary, the Abbot appeared to the writ, and
said that these places were parts of the town of
Westminster&mdash;&ldquo;sunt membra ville
Westm&rsquo;&mdash;;&rdquo; and for Westminster, Staines, and
their membr&aelig;, he claimed all their ancient privileges. <a

<p>But we must not receive this statement of Walter de Wenlock
with implicit confidence, or at all events without some further
explanation; <a name="citation21d"></a><a href="#footnote21d"
class="citation">[21d]</a> for it was this Abbot who transgressed
one of those salutary laws, which had been recently enacted to
stay the encroachments of the regular clergy.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>It was
this Walter of Wenlock, and of Westminster, who appropriated to
himself and his house in fee, lay fees in Knightsbridge,
Paddington, Eye, and Westbourn, without the license of the King;
and for which his successor was fined ten pounds.&nbsp; This
appears from the following entry on the Fine Roll, 12th Edw. II,
and in the Rotulorum Originalium in curia saccar&uuml;
abbreviatis,&mdash;vol. i. p. 245&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Abbas Westm&rsquo; finem fecit cum R. p

</blockquote>
<p>In the reign of the second Edward, we find that three
inquisitions were held, to enquire what injury that King would
sustain if certain tenements and lands in these places were
granted to the Convent; and it was upon one of these inquisitions
that the discovery above referred to was made. <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>As these inquisitions refer to the only bona fide grants of
land in Paddington or Westbourn, down to the fourteenth century,
which I have been able to discover, with the exception of the
purchase by Walter of Winchester before referred to; and as they
will serve to shew not only the sort of suit and service rendered
to the lord, but will also further illustrate the mode in which
the land in these places was actually acquired by the Abbey, I
shall give a translation of each.</p>
<p>These documents are kept in the Tower, and form a portion of
the &ldquo;Inquisitiones ad quod damnum,&rdquo; so called, and
are thus described in the calendar published by the Record
Commission.&nbsp; &ldquo;These inquisitions commence with the
first year of the reign of Edward the second, 1307, and end with
the thirty-eighth year of Henry the sixth: Thomas Astle, esquire,
thus speaks of them.&mdash;They were taken by virtue of writs
directed to the Escheator of each county; when any grant of a
market, fair, or other privilege, or licence of alienation of
lands, was solicited, to enquire by a jury whether such grant or
alienation was prejudicial to the King or to others, in case the
same should be made.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Inquisition a.

William de Padinton, Hugh de Arderne, William Est, Arnold le
Frutier, Simon le Brewere, Roger de Malthous, and Roger le
Marshall, junior: who say, upon their oath, that Walter de
Wenlock, lately Abbot of Westminster, had acquired to himself and
his House one messuage with appurtenances in Knyghtebregge, of
William le Smyth of Knyghtebregge, and four acres of land there
of William Brisel and Asseline his wife, and nine acres of land
there of William Hond, and twelve acres of land in Padinton of
William de Padinton, and three acres and a half in Eye of Hugh le
Bakere of Eye, and thirteen acres of land in Westbourn of John le
Taillour, and eleven acres of land there of Matilda Arnold, and
two acres of land there of Juliana Baysebolle after the
publication of the statute edited concerning the nonplacing of
lands in Mortmain and not before.&nbsp; And they say that it is
not to the damage nor prejudice of the Lord the King, nor of
others, if the King grant to the Prior and Convent of
Westminster, that the Abbots of that place, for the time being,
may recover and hold the aforesaid messuages and land to them and
their successors for ever.&nbsp; And they say that the aforesaid
messuage is held of the said Abbot and Convent, by service of a
yearly rent of six-pence, and of performing suit at the court of
the said Abbot and Convent, and of finding one man for two half
days to mow the Lord&rsquo;s meadow, price threepence: and it is
worth over and above that service in all issues twelve-pence a
year.&nbsp; And the aforesaid fifty-four acres and a half of
land, at the time of the aforesaid acquisition, were in like
manner held of the said Abbot and Convent by service of a yearly
rent of eighteen shillings and two-pence: and of finding one man
for ten half days to mow the Lord&rsquo;s meadow, price
fifteen-pence: and one man for ten half days to hoe the
Lord&rsquo;s corn, price ten pence: and of doing seven
ploughings, price three shillings and six-pence: and of finding
one man for ten half days to reap the Lord&rsquo;s corn, price
fifteen-pence: and of making seven carriages to carry the
Lord&rsquo;s hay, price three shillings and six-pence: and of
performing suit at the court of the said Abbot from three weeks
to three weeks.&nbsp; And they say that the aforesaid fifty-four
acres and a half of land are worth by the year in all issues over
and above the aforesaid services nineteen shillings and
six-pence.&nbsp; In witness <a name="page24"></a><span

<p>This sum of twenty shillings and sixpence was, as I conceive,
due to and paid to the King.&nbsp; So that although the Convent
had managed to obtain a lordship over this land, the King still
retained <i>some right</i> over it, and the fee of this land
could never have been given to the Abbot.&nbsp; But the result of
this inquisition does not appear to have been satisfactory to all
parties; for another was held in the twelfth year of the same
reign.&nbsp; It will be observed that the same land is the
subject of enquiry, but the significant words &ldquo;with
appurtenances,&rdquo; are added this time to each little
plot.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>From such small beginnings as these the present so-called
manors of Westbourn and Paddington arose.</p>
<p>Maitland, in his History of London, tells us that foreign
merchants were not able to land their goods at the port of London
previous to 1236, and that in that year they agreed to pay for
this privilege and &ldquo;to give the sum of one hundred <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>pounds
towards the bringing of the water to the city from Tyburn; which
the citizens were empowered to do by virtue of a grant from
Gilbert de Sandford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he further informs us, <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a> that in 1439,
&ldquo;the Abbot of Westminster granted to Robert Large, the
mayor, and citizens of London, and their successors, one head of
water, containing twenty-six perches in length and one in
breadth, together with all its springs in the manor of
Paddington; in consideration of which grant the city is for ever
to pay to the said Abbot and his successors at the feast of St.
Peter, two pepper corns.&nbsp; But if the intended work should
happen to draw the water from the ancient wells in the manor of
Hida then the aforesaid grant to cease and become entirely
void.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further added, &ldquo;This grant Henry the sixth not
only confirmed but likewise by a writ of Privy seal granted them
further advantages toward the performing thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is from Tanner&rsquo;s Notitia&mdash;&ldquo;Pat,
in Vaga Rageman temp Ric 2.&nbsp; Buckingh Rot 12. quod Abbas
debet mundare aquam vocat Bayard&rsquo;s Watering Place in paroch
de Padyngton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if we except these grants, which, we shall presently see,
were not so unimportant as may at first sight appear, I think we
may give the Abbots and monks the credit of keeping, as long as
they were allowed to keep, all they ever acquired or ever
possessed in Paddington.</p>
<p>But although the Abbots at length, and by slow degrees,
acquired to themselves and their House, either with or without
the sanction of the crown, both spiritual and temporal dominion
over these places, we must not imagine that all the tenements in
Westbourn and Paddington had been by this time transferred by the
devout and the timid to their safe keeping; for besides the few
small holders, who obstinately preferred their hereditary rights,
to the prospect of a speedy post-mortem release from purgatory,
there is good reason to believe that the ancient family of De
Veres held a considerable tract of land in this parish down to
1461.</p>
<h3><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
THE POSSESSIONS OF THE CHURCH,<br />
THE CROWN, &amp; THE PEOPLE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the lands which have
been claimed by the Bishop of London, and the Dean and Chapter of
Westminster, as their portion of the spoils of the Convent can be
completely written by those only who have free access to all the
records in the archives of St. Paul&rsquo;s and St.
Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And as it would appear that the time is not
yet come for placing at the disposal of the public, for public
uses, many of the important documents held in charge by Deans and
Chapters, we must be content with that account which can be
furnished by those which they have permitted us to see, and those
which more confiding holders have thrown open to our
inspection.</p>
<p>Most of the facts, which I have been able to discover,
relative to the acquisition of the Abbey lands in Paddington,
have been already related.&nbsp; One or two, however, having an
important relation to the lands of the existing church, and the
possessions of the people, remain to be told.</p>
<p>Aubrey de Vere, &ldquo;who came in with the Conqueror,&rdquo;
was grandfather to Aubrey, first Earl of Oxford, and held, as we
have already seen, a tract of land called in Domesday,
Chenesitun. <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; His eldest son, Geoffry having
been cured of a sickness by the Abbot of Abingdon, while grateful
for the skill and kindness shewn him, persuaded his father to
bestow the church of Kensington on that Monastery.&nbsp; The
grant was made, and confirmed by the next heir, Geoffry having
died during his father&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp; This footing
having been obtained, a subsequent Abbot claimed the privileges
of a manor for the lands given to that church.&nbsp; This claim,
which appears to have been set up previous to the issue of a
quo-warranto, seemed to <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the Earl then in possession, rather
more than his ancestors, in their liberality had given.&nbsp; He
appears to have opposed the claim: and it was ordered that the
matter should be investigated.&nbsp; From some cause or other,
however, the suit did not proceed, and the <i>Abbot&rsquo;s</i>
Kensington became a manor like its progenitor, the
<i>Earl&rsquo;s</i> Kensington; and so the Reformation found a
goodly quantity of land firmly grasped in the dead hands of the
Abingdon monks.&nbsp; This good thing, however, had not been kept
wholly to themselves.&nbsp; They had allowed their brothers at
Westminster to have a finger in the pie.&nbsp; And that portion
of this manor which was set aside for charitable purposes, was
intrusted to the charitable care, of St. Peter.&nbsp; This
portion of the Abbot&rsquo;s manor was valued, in the year 1371,
at five marks; while the other portion, &ldquo;the church and
vicarage,&rdquo; was valued at thirty-six marks. <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>In the patent roll which contains the grant of Henry the
eighth to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster&mdash;Pat. 34.
Henry 8. P. 5. M. 32. (6)&mdash;&ldquo;of the site of the late
monastery of Westminster, with all its ancient privileges, free
customs, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&rdquo; we find, at the foot of the
same membrane, this continuation of the grant &ldquo;all those
messuages, lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, feedings, rents,
reversions, services, and other our hereditaments whatsoever
known by the name or names of Seynt Mary Landes, lying and being
in Westbourne, in the parish of Paddington, in our said county of
Middlesex, and now or late in the tenure or occupation of John
Genie, or his assigns, to the said late monastery of St. Peter,
Westminster, lately belonging and appertaining, and being parcel
of the possessions of the said late monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not been able to discover the exact extent of these
lands at the time of the reformation; or the amount of their
growth during the last three centuries; but I have many reasons
for believing that these &ldquo;Seynt Mary lands lying and being
in Westbourne in the parish of Paddington,&rdquo; were the
self-same lands given by St. Mary of Abingdon to St. Peter of
Westminster for charitable purposes.&nbsp; That, in fact, this
land was the poor allotment of the manor of Abbot&rsquo;s
Kensington.</p>
<p>Out of this and another small grant the parvenu manor of
&ldquo;Knightsbridge and Westbourne&rdquo; was manufactured.</p>
<p>Besides these manors of Abbot&rsquo;s Kensington, and
Knightsbridge and Westbourn, another manor, called West-town, was
created out of lands called &ldquo;the Groves,&rdquo; granted to
&ldquo;his <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>dear and faithful chaplin, Simon Downham,&rdquo; by
Robert the fifth, Earl of Oxford, in 1214.</p>
<p>By an inquisition, taken in 1481, we are informed that the
Groves, formerly only three fields, had extended themselves out
of Kensington into &ldquo;Brompton, Chelsea, Tybourn, and
Westbourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Groves,&rdquo; now a manor, passed from Richard
Sturgion and William Hall to William Essex.&nbsp; The Marquis of
Winchester, Lord High Treasurer of England, purchased it of
Thomas Essex, for one thousand pounds, in May, 1570; and the next
marquis sold it to William Dodington for seven hundred pounds,
who sold it to Christopher Baker for two thousand pounds, and it
was afterwards purchased by Walter Cope for one thousand three
hundred pounds, who attached the Groves to Abbots Kensington,
which he had purchased. <a name="citation30a"></a><a
href="#footnote30a" class="citation">[30a]</a></p>
<p>But besides the manors, which the Abbots of Abingdon, and
Simon the priest, and the Abbots and Monks of Westminster, had so
nicely created for themselves, another, called &ldquo;the manor
of Notingbarons, alias Kensington,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Nutting
Barns,&rdquo; afterwards &ldquo;Knotting-barns,&rdquo; in
Stockdale&rsquo;s new map of the country round London, 1790,
&ldquo;Knolton Barn,&rdquo; now Notting-barns, was carved out of
the original manor of &ldquo;Chenesitun.&rdquo; <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a>&nbsp; And from an inquisition holden
in the fifteenth year of Edward the fourth, we find that this
manor remained in the hands of the De Vere&rsquo;s with Earls
Kensington, when John the twelfth Earl of Oxford, and his eldest
son, Aubrey, were beheaded.</p>
<p>This inquisition states, that &ldquo;John, late Earl of Oxon.
was seized to his own use, the fourteenth day of April, anno
regni 12 Edw. IV., of the manors of Kensington, and Knotting
Barns, in the county of Middlesex, and that afterwards, by a
certain Act, made in the Parliament, which began at Westminster,
the sixth of October, in the twelfth year of the reign of King
Edward the fourth, and by several prorogations continued to the
twenty-third of January in the fourteenth year of the King, it
was decreed that the Earl should <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>forfeit to the Lord the King all the
manors, lands, and tenements which he, or any one to his use had,
and that the manors of Kensington were accordingly
forfeited.&nbsp; The jurors say the said manor of Kensington is
worth, in all issues, beyond outgoings, twenty-five marks per
annum; and that from the fourteenth day of April, anno twelve,
the issues and profits have been and are taken and received by
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, but by what right or title they know
not.&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>By this inquisition we perceive that these manors were no
longer held by the De Vere&rsquo;s in virtue of their office of
Lord Great Chamberlain; but that this Earl died, possessing the
manors &ldquo;<i>seized to his own use</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by
an Act of the eleventh year of Henry the seventh, we find out
what the jurors did not know, viz.&mdash;That the widow of the
beheaded Earl, &ldquo;by compulcion, cohercion, and
emprisonement,&rdquo; while her son was suffering for his support
of the Lancastrian cause, was obliged to release to Richard
&ldquo;late in dede, and not of right, King Englond, while he was
Duke of Gloucetir,&rdquo; divers manors, lands, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; This being in all probability one of them.</p>
<p>When the said Richard had been dispatched in Bosworth field,
and Henry the seventh had ascended the throne, these acts of the
usurpers &ldquo;inordynate covetyse, and ungodly
disposicion&rdquo; were quietly put aside by regular Acts of
Parliament.&nbsp; And by the first and eleventh of Henry the
seventh, not only this Earl of Oxford, but all his family, were
reinstated in their estates, honors and dignities.&nbsp; And by
the latter act the compulsory release which Richard had obtained
from Elizabeth, Countess of Oxenford, was rendered null and
void.&nbsp; But during all these troubles the Earl appears to
have got into debt, to discharge which he appears to have sold
&ldquo;a messuage, four hundred acres of land, five acres of
meadow, and one hundred and forty acres of wood in
Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In giving us this information, Mr. Faulkner also tells us that
the estate was recovered by &ldquo;The Great Marshall of
England,&rdquo; and sold to Sir Reginald Bray for four hundred
marks.&nbsp; He also corrects a mistake into which Lysons has
fallen; and shews that it could not have been the original
portion of the manor, or the manor of Earl&rsquo;s Court, that
was sold, and suggests that it may have been &ldquo;one of the
smaller manors of West-town or Knotting Barns.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Lysons and Faulkner throw no further light on this subject.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>The
truth being that it was this manor of Notting Barns which was
purchased by Sir Reginald, or Sir Reynolde as it is frequently
written; and it was this manor which the generous Lady, in whose
service he was engaged for so many years, purchased of him to
complete the establishment of her munificent foundations.</p>
<p>Widmore tells us that this lady, Margaret Countess of
Richmond, mother of King Henry the seventh, obtained a licence of
Mortmain for one hundred and fifty pounds per annum, and that she
proceeded so far as to convey ninety pounds of it to the Convent
of Westminster, for the purpose of an anniversary for herself,
for three monks to celebrate mass in the Abbey Church, and for
the payment of the salaries of the professors founded by her in
the two universities, and her Cambridge preacher.&nbsp; And we
learn by her will, and by the Valor Ecclesiasticus, that besides
the establishment of these professorships, ten pounds per annum
was to be given to the poor out of the estates she left for these
purposes.&nbsp; We also learn by her will, and by an entry in
that Ecclesiastical valuation, which was taken by order of her
grandson, in the twenty-sixth year of his reign, that a
considerable portion of the land given by the Lady Margaret, for
the purposes named, then lay in Paddington.</p>
<p>In her will, we find, after the notice of the &ldquo;licence
given unto us by the King our Soverain Lord and most dere
son,&rdquo; and the mention of lands at Drayton, Woxbrig
(Uxbridge), and other places, the following words, &ldquo;and
also diverse londs and tenements in Willesden, Padington,
Westbourn and Kensyngton, in the county of Midd&rsquo;x, which
the said Abbot, Prior, and Convent, at their owne desire, and by
their entire assents and consents, have accepted and taken of
us&rdquo; at such a &ldquo;yerely valow,&rdquo; and for such
purposes, as therein specified.</p>
<p>We also find in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry the 8th,
under the heading&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Fundacio Domine
Margaret, Comitisse Richmond.<br />
<span class="smcap">Midd</span>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and after the mention of property at Drayton, Uxbridge, and
Willesden, to the amount of fifteen pounds, six shillings and
eight-pence, these words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Et tenet&rsquo;
in Padington . . &pound;10.&rdquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the fifth folio of 441 Lansdowne Manuscripts, the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>indentures
entered into by the Abbot of Westminster and the Lady Margaret
Countess of Richmond respecting the disposal of her property, we
find the same fact thus stated:&mdash;&ldquo;and also dyvers
landes and tenements in Willesden, Padyngton, Westburn, and
Kensington in the countie of Midd. which maners, landes and
tenements the said Princes late purchased of Sr Reynolde Bray,
Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this evidence is sufficiently conclusive to prove that
this manor of Notting Barns, sold to Sir Reginald Bray, was
purchased by the Lady Margaret for the purposes of her
bequests.</p>
<p>It is true that this notable Knight and most noble mason, <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a> sold another estate &ldquo;for 400
marc steryling,&rdquo; which is described as &ldquo;lying and
being in Tybourne, Lilliston, Westbourn, Charying, and
Eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was sold &ldquo;to Thomas Hobson,
gent.;&rdquo; and called &ldquo;the maner of Maribone,&rdquo;
which is said to have consisted of &ldquo;all the meses, lands,
tenements, &amp;c. which were of Robert Styllington, late Bishop
of Bath and Welles and of Thomas Styllyngton cosyn and Heyre of
the same Robert.&rdquo; <a name="citation33b"></a><a
href="#footnote33b" class="citation">[33b]</a></p>
<p>It may also be true that Sir William, afterwards Lord Sands,
or Sandys, succeeded by the aid of William, Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Chancellor of England, the Lord Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas, &ldquo;and divers other friends of both
parties,&rdquo; in dividing the great property left by Sir
Reginald Bray, between himself and the nephews to whom Sir
Reginald had left it in his will.&nbsp; And it is perfectly true
that Sir William, who &ldquo;had married the daughter and heir of
Sir Reginald&rsquo;s elder brother John,&rdquo; came into the
possession of property in Paddington by this Star Chamber
decision.&nbsp; But this was through his having had the manor of
Chelsea as a portion of his share of Sir Reginald&rsquo;s lands
assigned to him.</p>
<p>Neither this &ldquo;honest country lord,&rdquo; this
&ldquo;merry gamester,&rdquo; whom Shakspeare has immortalized,
nor the &ldquo;Gent.&rdquo; whose choice is still a proverb, held
land in Paddington long.&nbsp; Both Lord Sands, and Thomas
Hobson, exchanged their lands and manors of Chelsea, and
Marylebone, with Henry the eighth, for other manors and lands;
and the manor of Chelsea with those lands in Paddington which had
belonged to Lord Sands were <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>settled on Katherine, the widowed
queen of the many-wived murderous monarch.</p>
<p>The beautiful, and perfectly preserved, illuminated indenture,
in the Lansdowne collection, B.M., to which I have just now
refered, more fully than the Countess&rsquo;s will, which was
printed in 1780, with other royal wills of an anterior date,
details the donor&rsquo;s desires with respect to the property
she had disposed of.&nbsp; How far those desires and wishes have
been carried out, others can tell much better than I can.&nbsp;
No expense or pains appears to have been spared by the munificent
donor to make her bequest in accordance with the law, and so far
as her knowledge went, useful to posterity.&nbsp; Her Cambridge
and Oxford professors are still known.&nbsp; But where is her
grant to the poor?&nbsp; Are her professors still paid the
stipends she fixed for them; or do the readers and the preachers
divide between them the large estates she left?&nbsp; Where is
that large estate in Paddington, which was valued in her
grandson&rsquo;s reign at the exact amount she left to the
poor?</p>
<p>Besides the charitable bequests made by the Countess of
Richmond, she left &ldquo;divers other parcels of the same
maners, londes, &amp;c.&rdquo; valued at six pounds, thirteen
shillings and four-pence per annum to her faithful servant
Elizabeth Massey; and we find an account of &ldquo;part of the
descent of Massye, of Paddington,&rdquo; down to 1626, in the
Harlein collection of MSS. No. 2012, p. 45.</p>
<p>The first authentic document I find relating to the Notting
Barns manor after it was disposed of by the Countess of Richmond
is an inquisition, taken at Westminster on the ninth of October,
in the seventeenth year of the reign of Henry the eighth, after
the death of Robert Roper, or Fenroper, citizen and alderman of
London. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>From this inquisition we learn that &ldquo;The manor called
Notingbarons, alias Kensington, <i>in the parish of
Paddington</i>, was held of the Abbot of Westminster as of his
manor of Paddington by fealty and twenty-two shillings
rent;&rdquo; that the manor at this time &ldquo;consisted of
forty acres of land, one hundred and forty acres of meadow, two
hundred acres of wood, twenty acres of moor, twenty acres of
furze and heath, and forty shillings rent; and that it was valued
by the jurors at <i>ten pounds per annum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
manor, a lease of which had been, in all probability, purchased
of the Abbot by the aforesaid Robert, was left by the Alderman to
his wife for life, &ldquo;Remainder to <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Henry White, gent., and Etheldreda
his wife, one of his three daughters and co-heirs.&rdquo; <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a></p>
<p>What &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; was made at the time of the
Reformation with respect to this manor I cannot precisely tell;
but its further history, so far as I have been able to trace it,
is not without interest.</p>
<p>Lysons tells us in his account of Paddington, that &ldquo;a
capital messuage called Westbourne-place, with certain lands
thereto belonging was granted by Henry the eighth, in 1540, to
Robert White;&rdquo; and he refers to the Augmentation Office,
but to no special record there, for his authority.&nbsp; This
grant I have not been able to find.&nbsp; But in his account of
Kensington, Lysons says Henry White, the son-in-law of the
alderman, &ldquo;in the year 1543 conveyed the manor of Knotting
Barns to the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a deed of exchange recited in Pat 34. Henry 8th. P. 8., M.
13 (15), I find that the King purchased <i>Robert</i>
White&rsquo;s interest in this manor, and that &ldquo;the said
Robert White, esquire, having bargained and sold the manor of
Nutting Barnes, with the appurtenances, in the county of
Middlesex, and the farm of Nutting Barnes, in the parish of
Kensyngton, and the capital messuage with the appurtenances
called Westbourne in the parish of Paddington, in the same
county, and also the wood and lands called Nutting Wood,
Dorkyns-Hernes, and Bulfre Grove, in the parish of Kensington, as
also two messuages and tenements in Chelsaye, with all other the
possessions of the said Robert White, in the same places and
parishes; and in consideration of one hundred and six pounds,
five shillings and ten pence&rdquo; had other lands conveyed to
him, by the King, in other places, as fully set forth in the
patent above referred to. <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a>&nbsp; It will be
observed, that in this document, which is of a later date than
the dissolution of the monastery, a portion of this manor is now
said to be in the parish of Kensington.&nbsp; It appears that the
manor was made up of two farms (over and above the small
tenements), one called Notting Barns, and the other Westbourn;
and we find from a manuscript document, dated thirty-eighth <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Henry the
eighth, <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> that the &ldquo;messuage called
Westbourne, with the lands purchased of Robert White,&rdquo; were
demised to one Thomas Dolte, at a rent of one hundred shillings
per annum; the same sum on which this Thomas Dolte was charged in
the subsidy levied in the sixteenth year of this reign. <a
name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a>&nbsp; This farm appears to have been
but half the manor purchased by the Countess of Richmond, and
this half remained in the parish of Paddington, while the Notting
Barns farm seems to have been considered a part of Kensington,
after the Reformation.</p>
<p>From this M.S. in the land revenue office we also learn that
Henry the eighth purchased the then existing interest in other
lands in this parish, and in the parishes of St. Margaret,
Westminster, and Kensyngton, of one John Dunnington.&nbsp; The
gross rental of which I find was put down at nine pounds thirteen
shillings and fourpence; &ldquo;from which there was an
allowance, for lands inclosed within the king&rsquo;s park of
Hyde, of twenty-eight shillings per annum; leaving the clear
yearly value of eight pounds five shillings and
fourpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same document shews, too, that a
separate rent of forty-one pounds six shillings and eightpence
was received for the manor and rectory of Paddington.</p>
<p>Faulkner states that &ldquo;in 1549 king Edward the sixth,
granted this manor or farm of Notting Barns to Sir William
Pawlet, earl of Wiltshire,&rdquo; at a rent of sixty shillings
per annum.&nbsp; In 1562, and 1587, it appears to have been in
the hands of the lord treasurers of England, the marquis of
Winchester and lord Burghley.&nbsp; From lord Burghley it passed
to Sir Thomas Cecil who sold it to Sir Walter Cope of Kensington;
and in 1601 the queen &ldquo;granted a pardon to the said Walter
Cope, for the sum of six pounds, in consideration that the above
alienation had been made without her majesty&rsquo;s
licence.&rdquo; <a name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a></p>
<p>Thus the Notting Barns manor was claimed by the crown <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and by
private individuals; and so this portion of the Lady
Margaret&rsquo;s gift was disposed of.</p>
<p>But with &ldquo;the messuage called Westbourne, and the lands
purchased of Robert White,&rdquo; we have something more to
do.</p>
<p>Thomas Hues, esquire, doctor of medicine, one of queen
Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;principal physicians,&rdquo; purchased of
that queen and others, a considerable quantity of land, in this
and the adjoining parishes, fully described in Escact, 2. Eliz.
part 2. No. 23, which he gave to his wife for her life,
&ldquo;And in remainder to the Wardens and Fellows of Martyn
(Merton) college in Oxford, for the purpose of founding within
the said college for evermore two apt and meet persons to be
Fellows of the Fellowship of the said College.&nbsp; Or else
three scholars, or four, as the land will extend unto, at such
times as the same shall come to the hands and possession of the
said Warden and Fellows of the said college or to their
successors for the time being; to have continuance and succession
within the said college as fellows or scholars thereof for
evermore.&nbsp; There to be found, governed, and used with the
revenues of the said lands, and to be brought up and educated in
virtue and good learning according to the rules, good order, and
diet of the said College, whereby other the Fellows or Scholars
of the said House have in time past been well governed, ordered,
ruled and brought up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By Pat. 2. Mary, P. 1, we learn other particulars respecting
the messuages, tenements, &amp;c., which were purchased by Dr.
Hues.&nbsp; We find the cost of the whole to have been three
hundred and forty-six pounds, one shilling and eight-pence
halfpenny; that they were purchased of various owners; and that
&ldquo;a message and tenement called Westbourne&rdquo; was
included in the purchase, and that &ldquo;four closes of land
called by the names of Darking Busshes, Holmefield, Balserfield,
and Baudeland, and six acres of arable land lying apart in the
common fields; and six acres of arable land lying apart in the
fields called Dowries, all in the parish of Paddington&rdquo;
were purchased of the crown.</p>
<p>As a description of these four closes of land is still
preserved in the Harleian M.SS. No. 606, f. 46 b., I have thought
it right to translate and print it in this place, it is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A parcel of the
possessions of the late lord Sands.<br />
County of Middlesex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An account of four pasture closes in and near
Paddington <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>in the county aforesaid, containing, by estimation,
fifty acres, lately in the tenure of John Kellet by indenture for
a term of years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One.&mdash;A close called Darking Busshes <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> lying between the close called Sunhawes
on the southern side, and between the field called Wrenfelde on
the northern side, and extending in length over the green called
Kellsell Greene on the eastern side, and over the land belonging
to Notting-barns called Dorkinghernes on the western side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another.&nbsp; A close called Homefelde and extending
above the road leading from Paddington to Harlestone on the
eastern side, and above the close called Reding-meade on the
western side, and abutting upon the close called Church-close on
the southern and western sides, and upon the angle of
Reding-meade aforesaid on the northern side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another close called Balserfeld, extending in length
upon a piece of land called Lytle Balserfeld on the northern
side, and upon a close called Horsecreste and Ponde-close on the
southern side, and on one head of the land abutting upon the
west-lane on the western side, and upon Reding-meade aforesaid on
the eastern side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another close called Bandelonds lying between the close
called Swanne lease and Three acres on the northern side, and a
close called Downes on the southern side, and one head abutting
upon a close called Abbot&rsquo;s-lease, and upon the Green-lane
or Kingefelde-green on the eastern side, and upon the close of
Notting-barnes on the western side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">They are worth &pound;4.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following memorandum is added to this
description:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mem.&mdash;<i>That the rent of the premises

</blockquote>
<p>These were the closes in Paddington then, which belonged to
Lord Sands; and it will be seen by this memorandum, and by the
patent, that although this land was considered a part of Chelsea
manor, it was no part of Chelsea parish at that time. <a
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a></p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>In
1536, Lord Sands alienated the advowson of Chelsea and his manor
of Chelsea to the King, in exchange for other lands.&nbsp; By the
words of this transfer, which is printed from the original
document in Faulkner&rsquo;s Chelsea, <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> we find, that the
hereditaments conveyed to the King lay &ldquo;in the parish of
Chelcheth aforesaid and Paddington.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in &ldquo;A
peticular booke of Chelsey manor 1554,&rdquo; relative to the
possessions of Queen Katherine, we find these four closes
&ldquo;in Paddington,&rdquo; mentioned as having been then let at
four pounds per annum, to Henry White.</p>
<p>Faulkner speaks of the transfer of the manor of Chelsea to
Edward the sixth by the Duke of Northumberland, and of other
surrenders backwards and forwards; but neither in his works nor
in Lysons can I find anything about Dr. Thomas Hues&rsquo;
purchase; or one word about his gift to Merton.&nbsp; Neither can
I find any notice of this liberal bequest in any of the Histories
of the University of Oxford which I have examined.</p>
<p>What &ldquo;arrangement,&rdquo; then has been come to
respecting this property?&nbsp; Are any learned fellows or poor
scholars benefitted by this physician&rsquo;s bequest?&nbsp; Or,
is this estate like the other portion of the Lady
Margaret&rsquo;s gift, safely lodged in private hands?</p>
<p>I must confess that I am not able to answer these
questions.</p>
<p>But it would appear that the large and valuable estates
bequeathed by the Countess of Richmond and Dr. Hues do not
include the whole of the &ldquo;College Land&rdquo; in
Paddington.</p>
<p>Lysons in his Environs, and Chalmers in his History of the
University of Oxford, tell us that the Manor of Malurees,
&ldquo;consisting of some houses and about one hundred and twenty
acres of land,&rdquo; situated in the parishes of Willesden,
Paddington, Chelsea, and Fulham, was surrendered by Thomas
Chichele to King Henry the sixth, who granted it to the Warden
and Fellows of All Souls College in Oxford; and this grant has
not been wholly lost to this College, for I believe that down to
the present day a rent is paid to All Souls for some portion of
this land.</p>
<p>One of the most important preliminaries to the great
Reformation was the institution of a new valuation of church
property.</p>
<p>The King and people, saw how inefficiently Pope
Nicholas&rsquo;s taxation represented the value of church
property in the sixteenth century, for if it had not progressed
in value <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>in the same proportion as other property, still the
difference between the values in Edward and Henry&rsquo;s time,
was very considerable; and it required no conjuror to tell that
the clergy had ceased to pay their fair quota towards the
national expenditure.</p>
<p>Yet the difference between the Pope&rsquo;s valuation and the
reforming King&rsquo;s, is far less than the actual value of
church property in Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign and that which is
entered on &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is true
that the clergy are now taxed differently from what they were
before the Reformation; and that &ldquo;the first fruits and
tenths&rdquo; no longer go into the national exchequer.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;the Queen&rsquo;s bounty&rdquo; would find the benefit of
a valuation taken in our Queen&rsquo;s reign; and if this payment
of first fruits and tenths was anything like what it pretended to
be, the whole of the first year&rsquo;s income, and the tenth of
all future years, those who dispense that bounty would not have
to be so parsimonious in their assistance to the poorer
clergy.</p>
<p>To the Record Commission we owe the publication of that
valuation which was taken by King Henry the eighth, as well as
that taken by Pope Nicholas the fourth.</p>
<p>In addition to the quotation I have already given from the
former valuation, the following entries are to be found in it
relative to Paddington:&mdash;</p>

<p>The year after this survey was taken, all monasteries,
priories, and other religious houses, whose possessions did not
amount to two hundred pounds per annum, were given by the
twenty-seventh of Henry the eighth, chap. 28, with all their
manors, lands, &amp;c. to the King and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p>By this Act, the lands belonging to Kilbourn Priory became the
property of the crown; and in the following year these lands were
exchanged to Sir William Weston, the prior <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of the
Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, for the manor of Paris Garden
in Southwark.&nbsp; The twenty-eighth of Henry the eighth, chap.
21, which recites the indenture relative to this exchange, states
that the demesne lands of the said priory were &ldquo;in
Kylbourne aforesaid, Hamstedd, Padyngton and
Westbourn.&rdquo;&nbsp; And besides these demesne lands, other
lands and wood, with &ldquo;one woode conteynying by estimation
twenty-nine acres,&rdquo; are also said to be &ldquo;set and
beynge in Kylborne and Padyngton aforsayde.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that
it would appear the nuns of Kilbourn as well as the monks of
Westminster had possessions in this parish.</p>
<p>By the thirty-first of Henry the eighth, chap. 13, the larger
monasteries shared the same fate as the smaller ones had done,
and the Abbey lands of this place, and those formerly belonging
to the priory, reverted again to the crown.</p>
<p>In the account which was rendered to the King by the ministers
appointed to receive the revenues which came to the crown on the
dissolution of Religious Houses, we find the value of the other
church property in this parish, set down thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Crown had other possessions in Paddington besides
those which fell to it by the suppression of Religious
Houses.</p>
<p>We have already seen that Henry the eighth obtained land here
by exchange and purchase, from Lord Sands, Thomas Hobson, John
Dunnington, and Robert White.</p>
<p>We have also seen that those lands which were purchased of
Lord Sands and Robert White by the crown were sold to Dr. Hues,
and given by him with other lands to Martyn College, Oxford.</p>
<p>Some part of those lands purchased of John Dunnington went to
increase the park made by Henry the eighth, viz. <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Hyde Park;
but what became of the remainder I have not been able to
discover.</p>
<p>What Henry the eighth did with the manor and rectory of
Paddington will be seen by the following translation of a portion
of a legal instrument still preserved in the Record Office,
Carlton Ride. <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Inrolments of
Leases 35. 36. Henry VIII. P. 65.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the seventh of January, in the thirty-second year of
his reign, the King, by an indenture and release, bearing that
date, did, by the advice and counsel of the court, for augmenting
the revenues of his crown, demise, grant and farm let, to Edward
Baynton, knight, <i>and Isabella his wife</i>, all the site and
capital messuage of the manor of Padyngton, in the county of
Middlesex, and all houses, edifices, barns, stables, dovecotes,
orchards, gardens and curtilages adjacent to the said site and
capital messuage.&nbsp; And also all lands, meadows, pastures,
commons, and hereditaments, commonly called the demesne lands of
the manor aforesaid; and another messuage and tenement with
appurtenances in the tenure of Edward North, esquire, situate and
being in Padyngton, in the county aforesaid.&nbsp; And all lands,
manors, feedings, pastures, commons, and hereditaments whatsoever
in Padyngton in the county aforesaid to the said messuage and
tenement belonging and appertaining, or with the messuage and
tenement occupied and being.&nbsp; Also all the rectory of
Padyngton in the said county of Middlesex; and all and every
tenth, oblation, profit, commodity, and emolument whatsoever to
the said rectory in any sort belonging or appertaining; which
said manor, rectory, messuage, lands, tenements, etcetera, were
part of the possessions of the late dissolved monastery of St.
Peter, Westminster, and which were formerly let to the aforesaid
Edward North, for a term of years; but excepting always and
reserving for our Lord the King, his heirs and successors, all
large trees and wood of and upon the premises growing and being,
to have and to hold all and singular the premises above specified
with their appurtenances, except as before expressed, to Edward
and Isabella, and their assigns, from the feast of the
Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, next following, until
the end of the term, and for a term of twenty one years next
following and fully completed; rendering thence annually to our
Lord the King, his heirs and successors, forty-one pounds,
six-shillings <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>and eight pence, legal English money, at the feasts of
St. Michael the Archangel, and the Annunciation of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, or within one month after the said feasts, in equal
portions, to the court aforesaid, during the time aforesaid,
&amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This indenture and release, which, so far as I know, has not
been noticed before, and which certainly is not spoken of in any
of the private Acts of Parliament relating to the manor and
rectory of Paddington, is recited at length in another indenture
and release, which <i>is</i> generally referred to, which was
made and dated the twenty-first day of December, in the
thirty-fifth year of Henry&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The manor and
rectory of Paddington, and that other &ldquo;messuage and
tenement with appurtenances in the tenure of Edward North,
esquire,&rdquo; being by it demised to Richard Rede, of London,
Salter, for a new term of twenty-one years.&nbsp; The large trees
and wood, as was usual in such cases, being again reserved for
the uses of the crown.</p>
<p>We have already seen by the entries in the Valor
Ecclesiasticus, taken by order of this King, that in the
twenty-sixth year of Henry&rsquo;s reign, twenty shillings per
annum, half the rental of the wood spoken of in this indenture,
which was then thirty acres in extent, was set apart for
charitable purposes; that the other half was appropriated to the
Blessed Mary&rsquo;s Chapel; that the manor, bringing in nineteen
pounds per annum, was dedicated to &ldquo;the New Work,&rdquo;
probably Henry the seventh&rsquo;s chapel; that the rectory was
valued to the Abbey at two pounds, six shillings and eight-pence;
that the tenement formerly belonging to the Countess of Richmond
was valued at ten pounds; and that the lands at Knightsbridge and
Westbourne were valued at eight pounds, one shining and
seven-pence.</p>
<p>We see, also, the possessions in Paddington formerly belonging
to the church produced the same rent within one shilling and
seven-pence, as these lands were valued at six years before. <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>But the crown was not in receipt of these reserved rents more
than three or four years after Henry&rsquo;s death; for his son,
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>then about
thirteen years of age, by his letters patent, granted the manor
of Paddington, with several other manors and rectories, together,
&ldquo;of the clear annual value of five hundred and twenty-six
pounds, nineteen shillings, and nine-pence farthing,&rdquo; to
Nicholas Ridley, then Bishop of London, and to his successors in
that see.</p>
<p>The following are the words in this patent which refer
expressly to Paddington&mdash;&ldquo;Necnon totum illud Moneriu
nrm de Paddington in dco com nro Midd cum suis juribs membris et
ptien univeis nup Monasteio Sci Petri Westm modo dissolut dudam
spectan et ptinen ac parell possessionu et revencionu ejusdem nup
Monastei dudam existen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newcourt, in his Repertorium, page 703, says &ldquo;The manor
and rectory of Paddington (which of old did belong to the
Monastery of Westminster) were by Edward the sixth, in the fourth
year of his reign, upon his dissolving the Bishoprick of
Westminster then lately erected by King Henry the eighth, given
to Dr. Nicholas Ridley, then Bishop of London, and his successors
for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this one might imagine that
Paddington had formed part of the possessions of that short-lived
see; which, indeed, Lysons, in his Environs, and Mr. Brewer, in
his &ldquo;London and Middlesex,&rdquo; distinctly state, but of
this I find no evidence whatever; and the words of the patent
itself, convey a different impression.&nbsp; There are in this
patent other places mentioned as having formed part of that see,
but as it will be observed, Paddington is stated to have formerly
belonged to the Monastery.&nbsp; It will be observed too, that
the rectory is not mentioned in the extract from the grant which
I have given, neither do I find it anywhere else alluded to,
specially, as is the case with certain other rectories given by
this patent.&nbsp; But the spiritualities in all the places
named, appear to have been given in general terms to the
Bishop.</p>
<p>When, with Newcourt, we use the word &ldquo;given,&rdquo; we
must not do the advisers of the young King the injustice to
suppose that no reservation of the rights of the crown was
provided for in this open letter; that indeed would be an
injustice, for besides the payment of certain specified sums, to
certain specified persons and officers an annual rent equal to
one-fifth of the sum remaining to the Bishop was to be paid by
him to the King, at his Court of First Fruits and Tenths every
Christmas day.&nbsp; Which annual rent was in lieu of the first
fruits and tenths paid by all bishops and incumbents. <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>In
estimating the first fruits of the manors and rectories granted
by the crown to Ridley, at one-tenth of the income they brought
in, no hard bargain was struck with the bishop; indeed the
calculation was evidently favourable to the future occupants of
the see.&nbsp; For not only did this mode of receiving the first
fruits do away with the inconvenience arising from having to pay
a whole year&rsquo;s income at once, a system which formerly,
when these first fruits bore something like a resemblance to the
actual annual income, compelled many a poor man to mortgage his
living, and involve himself and family in endless difficulty, but
it was actually a bonus to the bishops; for those who made the
calculation must have known that the seven bishops who preceded
Ridley held the See of London but fifty-four years. <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a></p>
<p>Intending, without doubt, to be liberal to the bishops, and at
the same time just to the crown, the calculation of the proper
sum to be paid in lieu of first fruits was made without any
reference to the possible, or probable, augmentation of the
income from the lands then granted.&nbsp; The advisers of the
young King knew that with the assistance of parliament fresh
arrangements could be made with future occupants of the see; and
they fixed the sum to be paid to the crown at one hundred pounds
per annum, <i>as the then fair proportion for all the lands given
by this patent</i>.</p>
<p>This sum has been paid for these possessions ever since that
time, as I am informed, though the revenue they produce has
increased upwards of four thousand per cent.</p>
<p>Whatever was the intention of the advisers of the young king,
however, in this regard, one thing is pretty clear, viz. that
Ridley, and several of his successors, received from the manor
and rectory of Paddington, not forty-one pounds, six shillings
and eightpence, the sum at which the manor was then let, but that
sum, minus one-fifth, deducted by the crown. <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a></p>
<p>Strype tells us <a name="citation46c"></a><a
href="#footnote46c" class="citation">[46c]</a> that in exchange
for the grants contained <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in this patent the bishop gave up to
the crown other lands to the annual value of four hundred and
eighty pounds, three shillings and ninepence, and Ridley has been
blamed for making this exchange; Strype, however, has well
defended him, and shewn that the see was in reality the gainer
even at the time the exchange was made; and if the present values
of the exchanged lands were compared I think it would be found
that the successors of Ridley had not lost by his bargain.</p>
<p>There is still preserved in the Record Office, Carlton Ride,
<a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a> a manuscript record which shews that
Henry Rede held the manor of Paddington in the ninth year of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The reserved rent being as before,
forty-one pounds, six shillings and eightpence.&nbsp; But the
wood was not included even in this second lease to Rede,
supposing he had one; for we are informed by this document that
the rent was increased twenty shillings, &ldquo;for the farm of
one wood called Paddington Wood, thus demised this year.&rdquo;
<a name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; And this omission does not
appear to have been accidental, for I found in another manuscript
in the same office <a name="citation47c"></a><a
href="#footnote47c" class="citation">[47c]</a> a memorandum dated
November 26th, 1561, to this effect: &ldquo;To speak to Mr.
Barton touching a certain wood at Paddington.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
that the mode of disposing of this wood had evidently been under
consideration.</p>
<p>The following is the account of the descent of the manor of
Paddington given by Lysons:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The manor of Paddington was leased in the
reign of Henry the eighth to Richard Reade for a long term, which
being expired, Bishop Abbot demised it in the year 1626,
(together with the capital mansion and rectory) to Sir Rowland
St. John, fifth son of Oliver Lord St. John, of Bletsoe), for the
lives of himself, his wife Sibyl, and their son Oliver.&nbsp; Sir
Rowland, died in 1645.&nbsp; The next year a survey of the manor
was taken by order of Parliament; which states the demesne lands
to have been six hundred and twenty-four acres, the reserved rent
forty-one pounds, six shillings and eight-pence.&nbsp; The great
house in which Sir Rowland St. John had lived was then in the
occupation of Alderman Bide.&nbsp; The manor was afterwards sold
by the Parliamentary Commissioners to Thomas Browne,
esquire.&nbsp; After the restoration (in the month of January,
1661), Oliver St. John, the only survivor in the <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>lease (then a
baronet), died without having renewed; upon which the estate fell
in to Bishop Sheldon, who granted it to his nephews Sir Joseph
Sheldon, knight, and Daniel Sheldon, esquire.&nbsp; The lease
continued for several years in that family, being renewed from
time to time.&nbsp; In the year 1741, it was purchased by Sir
John Frederick, baronet, and is now vested in Sir John Morshead,
baronet, and Robert Thistlethwayte, esquire, in right of their
wives, Elizabeth and Selina, daughters and co-heirs of Sir Thomas
Frederick, baronet, deceased, and grand-daughters of Sir John
Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already seen that Alderman Rede&rsquo;s lease was not
the original one granted by King Henry; and there are other
additions, and corrections required to make the statement above
quoted strictly correct.</p>
<p>Both the manor, and rectory, of Paddington were held by the
citizen&rsquo;s family &ldquo;for a long term,&rdquo; although
their first lease was but for twenty-one years; for I find no
mention of any other lessees till the reign of Charles the
first.&nbsp; I think it probable, however, that Sir Rowland St.
John, to whom it was leased in that reign, held it in the reign
of James the first; for in the eighteenth year of this reign I
find him charged on the subsidy roll twenty pounds for Land in
Paddington.</p>
<p>An ancestor of Sir Rowland St. John was related to the
Countess of Richmond, was appointed her chamberlain, and one of
the executors of her will.</p>
<p>The mother of Sir Rowland, lady Dorothy, was the only daughter
and heir of Sir John Rede of Oddington, in Gloucestershire; and
it was through her, as I suppose, that the Paddington lease came
into this family of St. John.</p>
<p>It was Bishop Mountayne who leased the manor of Paddington to
Sir Rowland St. John, in 1626, and not Bishop Abbot, as stated by
Lysons; for George Abbot was bishop of London only a few months,
and was translated to Canterbury in 1611.&nbsp; I learn from the
survey to which Lysons has referred, but which I think he could
not have examined for himself, that the lease granted by Bishop
Mountayne was dated the twenty-fourth of November, 1626, the
second year of Charles the first, the reserved rent for the manor
only, being forty-one pounds, six shillings and eight pence; the
wood of thirty acres before referred to, being now separately
leased for forty shillings per annum; and besides the payment of
this increased rent, the lessee was bound by this lease to find
the surveyor and steward of the said Lord Bishop, &ldquo;with
provision for man and horse during the holding of his court upon
the premises.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>At the time this parliamentary survey
was taken, the rectory, &ldquo;excepting the parsonage house or
houses,&rdquo; with the great tithe, was held by John Lisle, one
of the Commissioners of the Great Seal; and it was separately
valued at twenty-eight pounds per annum.</p>
<p>The ordinance which was issued on the sixteenth of November,
1646, for the sale of Bishops&rsquo; lands and estates for the
service of the Commonwealth, was followed by a valuation of these
estates in England and Wales; and from that valuation we learn
the following particulars relative to Paddington:&mdash;<a

<p>On the fourteenth of December, 1649, &ldquo;The manner of
Paddington w<sup>th</sup> ye appurten&rsquo;ces&rdquo; was sold
to Thomas Browne for the sum of three thousand nine hundred and
fifty-eight pounds, seventeen shillings and four pence. <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a></p>
<p>How long Mr. Browne enjoyed the revenues of this manor, or
what arrangement was come to with respect to this particular
purchase on the re-establishment of the episcopacy, I do not
know.&nbsp; Lysons informs us that &ldquo;by the parish accounts,
it appears Thomas Browne, esquire, was lord of the manor in
1657,&rdquo; and it is very probable he continued so after the
prelacy was restored; but unfortunately these parish accounts are
not now to be found; otherwise more information on this subject,
as well as many others, might be obtained.</p>
<p>When Dr. Gilbert Sheldon was appointed to the bishoprick of
London, after the restoration, he claimed the manor, <i>and
rectory</i> of Paddington.&nbsp; If he made his claim good, which
he appears to have done, it is quite evident that Sir Oliver St.
John stood in his former position with regard to this estate; and
although he might not have had the opportunity to renew his lease
between the restoration and his death, which took place in 1662,
(and not in 1661, as is asserted both by Lysons and Collins vide
Peerage, vol. vi.), <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>it is very evident from the directions given in his
will, which is dated twenty-eighth December, 1661, that he was
desirous of doing so.</p>
<p>I found Sir Oliver&rsquo;s will at Doctor&rsquo;s Commons; it
was proved on the twenty-eighth of June, 1662.&nbsp; He therein
directs the sale of certain estates for the purpose of paying his
debts, and for enabling his trustees to take another lease of the
manor, &ldquo;which he held of the Bishop of London in
Paddington&rdquo; at that time, and the lease was to be taken
either for three lives, or for twenty-one years.&nbsp; But the
new bishop had nephews, to whom, it appears he was more willing
to grant a lease of this manor than to those whose ancestors had
purchased it, and in whose family it had remained for upwards of
a century.</p>
<p>It would appear that Bishop Sheldon&rsquo;s relatives received
the profits of the manor and rectory of Paddington for nearly
eighty years; but Lysons has made a mistake in stating the manor
was purchased by Sir John Frederick in 1741; for in the preamble
of the first Act of Parliament <a name="citation50a"></a><a
href="#footnote50a" class="citation">[50a]</a> which I can find
relative to these lands it is stated that a lease bearing date
the fifth of August, 1740, was granted by Edmund (Gibson), then
bishop of London, to Sir John Frederick, during the lives of
Judith Jodrell, widow; John Afflick; and John Crosier. <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a>&nbsp; This in all probability was the
date of Sir John Frederick&rsquo;s first lease; and as this may
be considered the starting point in the modern history of the
manor and rectory of Paddington, now, <i>par excellence</i>,
&ldquo;The Paddington Estate,&rdquo; I shall reserve what more I
have to say on this subject for a future chapter.</p>
<p>On the ninth of November, in the thirty-eighth of Henry the
eighth, an inquisition was held on the property of Henry Horne,
who was found to have died, seized of &ldquo;one capital
messuage, three other messuages or tenements, and one close of
land containing by estimation six acres, with appurtenances, in
Paddington, which were holden of the lord king, as of his manor
of Paddington by fealty, and twelvepence rent for all services,
and not in chief; and they are worth by the year three pounds ten
shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Escaet 38th Henry VIII.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>In the
second year of the sixth Edward, William Francis was found to
have died seised of &ldquo;one messuage in Paddington, situated
between the highway called Watlyng-street, and beyond the eastern
side of the pont called Paddington pond; of two messuages called
the Bridge-house, and of one orchard to the said two messuages
adjacent; of four tenements upon Paddington-green; of one
messuage called Blasers in Paddington aforesaid, with a garden;
of two acres of land; of one croft in Paddington aforesaid; of
half an acre lying between the tenements of Henry Prowdfoot, late
of London, mason, and the ponds there called Paddington ponds on
the south side, and the land late of John Colyns on the north
side, and abuts on the king&rsquo;s highway called Watlyng-street
on the east; and the jurors find that the aforesaid messuages and
other premises in Paddington aforesaid are holden of Richard Rede
of London, as of his manor of Padyngton, in the county of
Middlesex, by fealty, and three shillings rent for all issues and
demands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Escaet 2; Edw. 6. part 2. No. 23.</p>
<p>Armigell Waad had licence to alien to Wm. Cecil, Knight,
&ldquo;A messuage and one hundred and twenty acres of land in
Kentish Town, Padintun, Hamstead, and St. Pancras.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pat. 5.&nbsp; Eliz. p. 7.</p>
<p>For these references I am indebted to Edlyne Tomlins, esq.,
and with the exception of those already given, they are all I
have been able to procure relative to the estates of private
holders of lands in olden times; and of the more modern estates
in Paddington I have not much to say.</p>
<p>The names still retained by several plots of land point to
their previous owners.&nbsp; Desborough House; <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> Little Shaftsbury House, and Dudley
House, speak for themselves of their former occupants.</p>
<p>Denis Chirac, jeweller to Queen Anne, built a large house on
Paddington-green, which was called Paddington house.&nbsp; And by
an entry in the vestry minutes for May, 1821, I find he was
admitted a tenant of the manor on the twenty-fourth of April,
1753, and was permitted to inclose the portion of the green in
front of his house.&nbsp; This house was situated at the
east-side of the green, very near to the Harrow-Road, and the
piece of land enclosed was a narrow strip along the southern-side
of the old green.</p>
<p>Lysons tells us &ldquo;Lord Craven has an estate in this
parish <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>called Craven-hill, on which is a small hamlet very
pleasantly situated;&rdquo; and that this nobleman &ldquo;whose
humane exertions during the dreadful calamities, the great fire
and plague of London, are so well known, observing the
difficulties which attended the burying of infected corpses in
1665,&rdquo; gave a piece of ground in the parish of St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-fields, east of Regent street, as a
burial-place during any future sickness. <a
name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a"
class="citation">[52a]</a>&nbsp; Carnaby market and other
buildings, were erected on this Craven estate, and Lysons adds,
&ldquo;when this ground was covered with building, it was
exchanged for a field upon the Paddington estate, which, if
London should ever be again visited by the plague, is still
subject to the said use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This land was not used, however, during the plague of
1848&ndash;49; and at the present time a grand London-square,
called Craven Gardens, alone indicates the site of the Paddington
pest-house field.&nbsp; This property consisting of two messuages
and nine acres of land was purchased by the trustees of this
charity-estate of one Jane Upton, widow, and her son, with
consent of the minor&rsquo;s trustees, for fifteen hundred and
seventy pounds. <a name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>The poor inhabitants of the parishes of St. Clement&rsquo;s
Danes, St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-fields, St. James&rsquo;s,
Westminster, and St. Paul&rsquo;s, Covent Garden, were to be
specially benefitted by these houses and this land.&nbsp; But I
must refer those who wish to know more of this charity to the
private acts concerning it.</p>
<p>Mr Orme, formerly a print-seller in Bond-street, purchased
property west of Craven-hill.&nbsp; Mr. Neild is the lessee of
all the land claimed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster in
this parish; and is said to have purchased land in and near
Paddington, of the descendants of Dr. Busby.&nbsp; A Mr. White
now owns land at Westbourn; the Grand Junction Canal Company; the
Grand Junction Water Works Company; and the Great Western Railway
Company, are large proprietors.&nbsp; Many pieces of land have
been given, and purchased for charitable uses; and in 1852 no
less than fifty persons claimed to be registered as county voters
for freehold land held by them in Paddington.</p>
<p>It is not, however, the object of this work to exhibit the <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>title deeds
of private owners of land in this parish; or to record all the
names of the owners of the soil; neither would I have it thought
that I wish to constitute myself a judge of the value of those
claims which have been set up by corporations, aggregate, or
sole.&nbsp; But the rights of a whole people cannot be set aside
by the single fact of possession; neither can individuals be
permitted much longer to enrich themselves, and their immediate
relatives, by applying to their own uses the proceeds of lands
consecrated to the people.</p>
<h4>COMMONS AND WASTE.</h4>
<p>Commons originally were those lands which had not been brought
into cultivation by the spade and the plough, over which, all who
used the spade and the plough had certain rights in common.&nbsp;
When the rights of the people over the soil were more limited by
the law, there was attached to every portion of arable land a
certain portion of waste, over which these common rights
extended; and these lands were as much, in proportion, the
property of the poorest occupier as of the richest holder.&nbsp;
Commons have also been defined to be &ldquo;wastes and pastures
which have never been exclusively appropriated by any individual,
but used in common by the inhabitants of a parish or
district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Paddington, the commons were in more senses than one,
&ldquo;commons without stint,&rdquo; for they were not only used
by the inhabitants all the year round, but the quantity assigned
was, for centuries, amply sufficient for all their wants; and
these commons in Paddington were not confined to that
&ldquo;<i>universal right</i>&rdquo; called &ldquo;commons
appendant,&rdquo; for the people here had the right of taking the
material from the neighbouring wood, for their fire as well as
for the repair of their houses, carts, and hedges.</p>
<p>To those who had obtained the lordship of the soil, the
preservation of these commonable rights was of much less
importance than to the people, for that which was gained by the
labourers&rsquo; toil from the waste, and the wood, went to
increase the domains of the lord, or to enrich some private
owner.&nbsp; To the lords, the Roman law which &ldquo;considered
the individual member of the state,&rdquo; was much more inviting
than the ancient law of England, which &ldquo;based itself upon
the family bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The better to secure individual rights, so acquired, the
cultivated land was enclosed.&nbsp; But this enclosure of lands
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>proceeded
so rapidly that the rights of all the poor in England, those who
could not find means to enclose, were in danger of being
annihilated.&nbsp; The state was at length compelled to
interfere, and the law provided that enough commonable land
should be left in each manor to provide for the fulfilment of the
usual commonable rights; and at the time of an enclosure it was,
as it still is, the custom when the poor had the right of
gathering their fuel from the waste and wood, and of turning
their live stock on the common, to set apart a portion of the
land for their uses, as a compensation for the loss of those
rights.</p>
<p>Where the allotment for the poor of Paddington was situated;
when it was set apart; or what was its extent, I have not been
able to discover from any positive evidence now existing; but my
impression is that the little piece of <i>charity land</i>
remaining in Westbourn indicates the site of a much more
extensive portion of the common field which was set apart for the
uses of the poor.</p>
<p>It is a popular notion that the lord of the manor is entitled
to the waste, but this is by no means the case in every
manor.&nbsp; In the neighbouring manor of Abbot&rsquo;s
Kensington, we find that &ldquo;the commons&rdquo; were
&ldquo;presented&rdquo; with &ldquo;Notting-hill, the waste by
the highways, and the Gravel Pits,&rdquo; as lately as 1672; <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> and in the ancient manors of Tybourn
and Lilestone, there was pasture for the cattle of the villagers,
and the fruits of the wood for their hogs. <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a></p>
<p>The usual proportion given to the lord for his right in the
soil is one-sixteenth. <a name="citation54c"></a><a
href="#footnote54c" class="citation">[54c]</a>&nbsp; Whether the
lords of the Paddington soil were content with this proportion we
need not enquire.&nbsp; We know that their demesne lands have
extended far beyond their original dimensions; and there is very
little doubt that the land of the poor diminished as the
lord&rsquo;s land increased.&nbsp; Other individual holders, too,
have carved out for themselves portions of that which was set
aside for purely public purposes, but the great delinquents have
been the lords of the manors&mdash;&ldquo;those relics of feudal
slavery and mediaeval barbarism;&rdquo; and these before long
will be known only in history.</p>
<p>It is true that waste land, and a common field existed in
Paddington down to a recent date; and it is equally true, that
some kind of right over this land was acknowledged to be vested
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in the
inhabitants of this parish; for as we shall presently see, when
this right was found to interfere with the designs of the lords
and their lessees, a portion of it was bargained for and
sold.</p>
<p>The common field appears to have existed on each side of the
Westbourn, extending, with the poor allotment, from that which is
now called the Uxbridge-road to a considerable distance north and
east; the portion on the western side the stream being called the
Westbourn, or Bayswater, field; the portion on the eastern side,
the Town field, corrupted into &ldquo;Downes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Paddington side, all that remained of the common waste
was the Village-green; and for this the villagers must have had
the greatest affection.&nbsp; It was <i>their</i> Home-field; on
it their forefathers had made merry, and here they had trodden by
hereditary right.&nbsp; Yes by hereditary right!&nbsp; And seeing
that the title of the noble has descended by law to his feeble
son, and the estates of the frugal man to his spendthrift heir;
how highly must the people of Paddington appreciate that justice
which has preserved to them so magnificent a portion of their
ancestors possessions! <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately for the reputation of the past there are but few
places to be found where the rights of the weak have not been
most shamefully encroached upon by the strong; and the little
village of Paddington affords not the least remarkable example of
these glaring defects in the working of &ldquo;our glorious
constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere, might has usurped the place of right;
cunning has lent a helping hand, and documents which would the
most plainly bear witness to this fact have been destroyed.&nbsp;
However, the one great fact that &ldquo;land has been lost&rdquo;
remains to speak for itself; and the &ldquo;eternal remedy&rdquo;
will assuredly come sooner or later, although the wronged be now
cast down, and the wrong doer walk so seemingly secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessings which civilization and philosophy&rdquo;
have brought with them have been undoubtedly a great benefit to
the poor as well as to the rich; and one of the most powerful
writers of the present day has thought it necessary to point out
how those benefits offer a compensation for the loss of many
ancient rights and privileges. <a name="citation55b"></a><a
href="#footnote55b" class="citation">[55b]</a>&nbsp; But
civilization and philosophy are not content with their past or
present doings, for there <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>are many civilized people, and
philosophers too, who believe the present arrangements give the
lion&rsquo;s share of those benefits to the rich; and there are
those who believe that present enactments are so unwise as to
facilitate the accumulation of riches by the least deserving
members of the state.&nbsp; Further
&ldquo;<i>compensation</i>,&rdquo; therefore, they believe to be
necessary, if the blessings which civilization and philosophy are
destined to work out in the beneficent decrees of universal lore
and justice are to be of present use to the people.</p>
<p>The tales told of the robberies of public property in
Paddington are more fitted for the pages of a romance or a novel,
than a sober history.&nbsp; And as to these robberies in
Paddington, the dramatist, the novelist, and the writers of
romance, have done much more than the historian to expose and
correct the vices of the past.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Charles Ollier&rsquo;s novels <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> contains so many allusions to this
place, that the reader is obliged to believe the elucidation of
its history formed one of the chief objects of the writer.</p>
<p>And if the incidents connected with Paddington Green and its
neighbourhood had not been more melo-dramatic than farcical, one
might have imagined that the little farce <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> in which Mr. Buckstone lately
delighted the Haymarket audiences had some reference to this
place.</p>
<p>Let those who believe the villagers&rsquo; green to be the
least altered place in Paddington, turn to Chatelain&rsquo;s
beautiful little delineation of it, as it appeared to him in
1750, or to a larger print published in 1783. <a
name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Linney&rdquo; would as
soon find out his &ldquo;eight acres,&rdquo; if he could now pay
us a visit, as would the present inhabitants of this place
discover any likeness of that which was, to that which now is,
Paddington Green.</p>
<p>In 1783, the enclosed green included all that land which
extends from its present eastern extremity to Dudley-house on the
west; that is to say, all the present Green, and all the land
south of the pathway, from the Green to St. Mary&rsquo;s Terrace;
and from the Harrow-road across this green there was a public
foot path to the church, the old church-yard and some houses.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>From
Chatelain&rsquo;s print we see that the Green, though not
enclosed so far westward in 1750, extended northward to the old
Church-yard, including the land on which the houses on the north
side of Paddington-Green have been built.&nbsp; A large pond
existed on the Green at that date, which was drained into
another, south of the Harrow-road, and as many of the present
inhabitants know, it has not been filled up many years. <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a>&nbsp; And between these ponds, to
command the road from Harrow, the people erected, during the
Commonwealth, one of those detached ramparts which they built up
by the side of every entrance into the capital, as a sign of
their determination to protect the liberties of England from the
advance of that tyranny which they had driven out, and which they
determined never again to endure. <a name="citation57b"></a><a
href="#footnote57b" class="citation">[57b]</a></p>
<p>Although the Green has wasted to its present dimensions, and
although the &ldquo;commons and waste,&rdquo; in Paddington have
vanished, the following notices, which I have found on the
minutes of the Vestry, will shew that the parish has received
<i>some</i> compensation for the inclosure of certain pieces of
waste, besides those purchased by the bishop and his
lessees:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Extracts from the Vestry Minutes</i>.&mdash;1794, September
twenty-second: at a meeting of the inhabitants, held this day,
Mrs. L. le Brown, of Black-lion lane, was permitted to fill up a
ditch and enclose the space of ___ feet by ___ feet, upon
condition of paying ten shillings per annum to the parish.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, Mr. Crompton presented the parish with
two plans, one of the entire parish, the other of the waste and
charity lands; both appear to have been taken in 1772, by Mr.
Waddington, land surveyor. <a name="citation57c"></a><a
href="#footnote57c" class="citation">[57c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>1795,
March 11th: Resolved that the parish do accept the offer of the
lessees of fifteen pounds per annum, as a compensation for the
waste belonging to the parish included in the bill now pending in
Parliament, provided the public and private roads are left of the
usual breadth prescribed by law.</p>
<p>1801.&nbsp; July 15th: Mr. Cockerell applied to enclose part
of the waste of Westbourne green, north and east of the
Harrow-road, and agreed to place in the hands of the trustees
enough money to produce a dividend of three pounds per annum.</p>
<p>On the eleventh of November, in the same year, Mr. White
proposed to transfer one hundred pounds to the names of trustees,
for the use of the poor, for permission to enclose a piece of
land near the Harrow-road and by the side of the canal.&nbsp; The
permission was granted.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly also made an application for another piece, but it
was resolved that, &ldquo;as it would have a tendency to
establish a precedent for the indiscriminate alienation of the
waste, this application cannot consistently with the interests of
the parish be complied with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1802, October 20th: Mr. Harper is allowed to enclose a piece
of waste, the quantity not stated; but the rent to be three
pounds per annum, per acre. <a name="citation58"></a><a
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a></p>
<p>In this year four hundred pounds were paid by Mr. Cockerell,
and one hundred pounds by Mr. White, for the land they had
enclosed.</p>
<p>1803, April 12th: the Parish apply to the Dean and Chapter of
Westminster for a piece of waste near Westbourn-green, on the
south side of the Harrow-road.&nbsp; The application
refused.&nbsp; The minutes of the same month,
twentieth&mdash;notice that the Bishop of London and his lessees
had refused to allow the parish to enclose that portion of the
Bayswater field belonging to the parish.</p>
<p>1812, September 1st: Mr. Hicks is allowed to enclose a piece
of waste, 440 feet long, by 25 feet in breadth, extending from
the Uxbridge-road along the south and west side of Black Lion
lane; and this he is permitted to do without payment, in
consequence of the services he has rendered to the parish for
forty years.</p>
<p>In September, 1818, there is a letter from George Gutch, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>on behalf the
Grand Junction Canal Company, to ask leave to fill up part of the
pond to make a street from the north Wharf-road, which the Vestry
agreed to, provided a slip of land, 116 feet long, by 13 feet 6
inches north and 12 feet south, adjoining the Alms&rsquo; houses,
be given to the Parish by the Company.</p>
<p>In 1825, forty-eight pounds, six shillings and six-pence was
paid by Mr. Jenkins, for permission to enclose a piece of waste
land near his grounds.</p>
<p>When Mr. Jenkins&rsquo;s land was sold, the parish attempted
to establish their claim to this waste, but the claim set up by
the bishop of London and his lessees, as lords of the manor
superseded it.</p>
<p>There is a notice on the minutes this year for the first time
respecting the interference of the lords of the manor in the
disposal of the waste lands.&nbsp; But although these lords at
this time claimed for themselves &ldquo;its entire
control,&rdquo; the vestry, nevertheless, gave their permission
to Mr. Orme to enclose a piece opposite his land, near the second
milestone on the Harrow road.&nbsp; No mention is made of money
paid on this occasion.</p>
<p>As late as 1830 an application from Mr. Nield was laid before
the vestry, for pieces of waste adjoining property leased to and
purchased by him; and on the seventh of June in the following
year, the Rev. chairman reported &ldquo;that Joseph Neild, Esq.,
M.P. had paid to the treasurer the following sums for waste
lands:&rdquo;</p>

<p>What took place with respect to the waste lands previous to
1794, there is, unfortunately, now no means of telling, for no
vestry minutes are to be found previous to 1793.</p>

CHARITY LANDS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question &ldquo;What has become
of the Charity Lands?&rdquo; which has been so often asked in
other parishes, has been occasionally put to those in authority
in this; but so far as I can discover, no satisfactory answer has

hear &ldquo;that charity has been so little needed here, that
much of that land which was given for this purpose, has been
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost all is &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; and
&ldquo;uncertain,&rdquo; in this Return, and this is the more to
be lamented, as it was about the time at which this report was
made that the value of land in Paddington began to be known by
those who intended to secure the sanction of the legislature to a
measure which would enhance its value.</p>
<p>Since that time, the &ldquo;Report of the Commissioners for
enquiring concerning Charities,&rdquo; (1826), has been
published, and some little light has been thrown on this
subject.</p>
<p>This report contains, in fact, almost all that I have been
able to discover relative to the Charity Lands; and I cannot do
better than reprint it in this place; adding what little
information I have been able to obtain.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The parish officers of Paddington were
unable to produce any deeds or other original documents relative
to the charitable funds of this parish; but they laid before us
the minutes of vestry, in which under date the twelfth of April,
1803, is an entry stating that the vestry clerk produced an
account of the estates, &amp;c. belonging to the parish, written
on vellum; and also several extracts from wills and other
documents relative to the titles of the said estates, which were
compared and examined with the said account by the vestry; and it
appearing that such account was correct, it was resolved that the
same be hung up in the vestry-room, and that a copy thereof be
entered upon and taken as part of the minutes of the vestry; and
which was so entered accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The account referred to, was made out by the late vestry
clerks, Messrs. Robertson and Parton, both of whom are since
dead.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>From
the account so entered on the vestry minutes the following
statement of the charities is chiefly taken:</p>
<h4>Bread and Cheese Lands.</h4>
<p>The lands thus denominated are said to have been given by two
maiden gentlewomen, for the purpose of supplying the poor with a
donation of bread and cheese, on the Sunday before
Christmas.&nbsp; Neither the names of the donors, nor the date of
the gift is known, but it is a very ancient one.&nbsp; The land
consists of three parcels, viz.</p>
<p>1.&mdash;A piece of arable land lying in the common field,
called Bayswater field, in this parish, containing two and a half
acres, in the occupation (at the time of taking the account) of
John Harper, Esq., at the rent of five guineas per annum.&nbsp;
This piece was formerly called Five Pieces, and afterwards Three
Pieces; it is now divided into two holdings; one, being one and a
half acres, is let to Samuel Cheese, as tenant from year to year,
at a rent of thirteen pounds; the remainder to Thomas Hopgood, as
tenant from year to year, at the rent of four pounds ten
shillings.</p>
<p>This land lies intermixed with lands respectively belonging to
the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and the Bishop of London;
and there is a dispute existing among these parties as to the
boundaries of their respective properties.&nbsp; The parish claim
an acre as belonging to Hopgood&rsquo;s holding, but they take
from the tenant rent for half an acre only, till the dispute be
settled. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>2.&mdash;Another piece of land (formerly two), containing one
acre, two roods, and twenty-four perches, lying on the southwest
side of the Harrow road at Westbourne Green, and forming part of
the lawn and grounds belonging to Westbourne-place, the property
of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, Esq.&nbsp; This land, at the time of
taking the account, was held by Mr. Cockerell at the annual rent
of seven pounds.&nbsp; It has since been demised to him by the
churchwardens and overseers, in pursuance of an order of vestry,
together with a small piece of waste land lying between the above
and the road, containing one acre and seven perches, which he has
enclosed and added to his lawn; making together one acre, three
roods, and thirteen <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>perches, for a term of sixty-three years from Christmas,
1805, at the annual rent of fifteen pounds.</p>
<p>This lease is granted in consideration of the surrender of a
former lease, and of the charge which the lessee had been at in
inclosing and cultivating the said piece of waste land, and of
the sum of money paid by him to the parish on account of such
inclosure; and it is provided that the lessee shall keep up the
nine stones, or land-marks, marked P. P. in the places where they
now stand, to ascertain the boundaries of the land; and that if
the land, or any part of it, or any part of the lawn or grounds
adjoining to it on the west and south, and within thirty yards of
the same, should, at any time during the term, be let for and
used as building ground, it shall be lawful for the churchwardens
and overseers for the time being, with the consent of the vestry,
to determine the lease at the expiration of any one year of the
said term, upon giving six months&rsquo; notice in writing.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;Another piece of meadow or pasture land, lying near
Black Lion lane, in this parish, containing one acre or
thereabouts, in the occupation of William Kinnard Jenkins, Esq.,
under a lease to Jacob Simmonds, for sixty-three years, from
Christmas, 1802, at the rent of eight pounds, eight shillings per
annum.</p>
<p>This lease appears from the vestry minutes to have been
granted to Mr. Simmonds, in consideration of his covenanting to
lay out the sum of three hundred pounds at least in building on
the land, and to contain a reservation of all timber, with power
for the grantors, (who are the churchwardens and overseers of the
parish) and their successors, to fell and carry away the same,
and to restrain the lessees from digging brick-earth, sand, or
gravel for sale, or from carrying such earth, sand, gravel or
bricks off the land.</p>
<p>Simmonds built a good house upon the premises, which have been
materially improved by the present tenant.&nbsp; Much more than
the stipulated sum has been expended there.</p>
<p>It appears to us that all the foregoing rents are adequate to
the present value of the respective premises.</p>
<p>With the rents of this land it was formerly the custom to
purchase bread and cheese, which, on the Sunday before Christmas,
were thrown down from the church among the poor assembled in the
church-yard.&nbsp; Latterly, a less objectionable mode of
distribution has been adopted: bread and coals are now given by
the minister and parish officers to poor families inhabiting the
parish, of whom a list is made out annually <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>for the
churchwardens, stating their residence and occupation, and the
number of children under ten years of age: and we are assured
that much care is taken in selecting those to receive this gift
who are most deserving.&nbsp; One or two four-pound loaves, and
one or two bushels of coals are given to each family, according
to the number it consists of.&nbsp; No distinction is made
between parishioners, and unsettled resident poor, nor between
such as do not receive parochial relief.</p>
<h4>Johnson&rsquo;s Charity.</h4>
<p>The account above referred to mentions a rent-charge of one
pound a-year, given by Thomas Johnson, merchant-tailor, of
London, issuing out of three houses on the east side of
Paddington Green, and payable on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day in every
year, in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

Wood</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It is not stated when this benefaction was given, nor to what
purposes it was appropriated.</p>
<p>In the returns of 1786, it is said that this, and Mrs.
Robertson&rsquo;s benefaction after mentioned were given for
apprenticing poor children; but they are not now so
applied.&nbsp; It appears indeed that Johnson&rsquo;s rent-charge
goes into the churchwarden&rsquo;s general account, and it is not
the subject of any particular application.&nbsp; This seems to
have arisen from inadvertence, as it is understood to have been a
charitable gift; and we are assured that it shall in future be
corrected.</p>
<h4>Dr. Compton&rsquo;s Charity.</h4>
<p>There is a copyhold estate in the Harrow-road, held of the
manor of Paddington, and which is stated in the account to have
been the gift of Dr. Compton, bishop of London, lord of the said
manor, by the description of &ldquo;one cottage and a piece of
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The estate now consists of six houses: one of these is at
present occupied as a poor house, the rest are let and occupied
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>It does
not appear from &ldquo;the account&rdquo; what specific
application was directed to be made of this property by Dr.
Compton.&nbsp; The rents are now applied, under a recent
resolution of the vestry, towards the maintenance of the
charity-school in this parish.&nbsp; Before this resolution, the
rents were carried to the overseers&rsquo; general account, and
an annual sum of fifty-pounds was paid by the parish towards the
maintenance of the charity-school.&nbsp; The school is large
containing two hundred or three hundred children.&nbsp; The
expense of it far exceeds the amount of all the rents now applied
to its support.</p>
<p>Successive admissions are found on the court-rolls of the
manor of Paddington, of certain parishioners as tenants of this
and the other copyhold property mentioned below, to the use of
them, their heirs and assigns, in trust for the use and benefit
of the poor of the parish of Paddington.&nbsp; The last of these
entries bears date the ___ 1822, when the late Francis Maseres,
esq., John Symmons, esq., the Rev. Charles Crane, D.D., Samuel
Pepys Cockerell, esq., Joseph Neild, the younger, esq., John
White, esq., and Benjamin Hall, esq., were admitted tenants in
trust in the form above stated.</p>
<h4>Margaret Robertson&rsquo;s Charity.</h4>
<p>It appears from &ldquo;the account&rdquo; that Mrs. Margaret
Robertson, by will, dated sixteenth September, 1720, gave for the
use of the poor of this parish, a copyhold estate, on the west
side of the Edgeware-road, consisting of a messuage and
garden.</p>
<p>This property now comprises five houses lately erected under
an agreement, dated first March, 1823, whereby in consideration
of the surrender of a former lease for sixty-two years, from
Lady-day, 1763, at the rent of three pounds ten shillings, the
trustees agreed with Stephen Haynes, that they would, as soon as
the five messuages, therein agreed to be built, should be covered
in, grant to him a lease of the said premises, for the term of
twenty-one years, from Lady-day, 1824, at the rent of fifteen
pounds, clear of all taxes, with the usual covenants for repairs;
and the said Stephen Haynes covenanted to pull down the old
buildings, and erect thereon five substantial messuages,
according to the specification therein contained.&nbsp; These
premises lie at the junction of the Harrow and Edgeware roads,
and adjoin two small houses newly erected, which come up to the
point of junction, belonging to another proprietor.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>This
rent is applied, under the orders of the vestry, to the support
of the charity-school.</p>
<h4>Alms&rsquo; Houses and School-house.</h4>
<p>There is in the parish a set of alms&rsquo; houses, copyhold
of the manor of Paddington, consisting of seventeen dwellings,
containing one apartment each.&nbsp; Thirteen of these, as
appears by an inscription in front of the building, were erected
in 1714, at the expense of the inhabitants, for the poor past
their labour.&nbsp; The four additional dwellings were built by
Samuel Pepys Cockerell, esq.: two of them to be occupied as
alms&rsquo; houses, and two for the master and mistress of the
charity-school.</p>
<p>The alms&rsquo; houses are inhabited by paupers placed there
by the parish.&nbsp; The charity-school has been built near these
alms&rsquo; houses, upon copyhold land, granted for the purpose
by the present bishop.&nbsp; The expense of this erection was
defrayed from subscription in the parish, and by the application
of certain monies received by the parish as a consideration for
the enclosure of some waste land.</p>
<h4>Chirac&rsquo;s Gift.</h4>
<p>Denis Chirac, esq., by his will, dated ninth August, 1775,
gave to Francis Maseres and Peter Paget, esqrs., one hundred
pounds to be laid out or applied as they should think proper for
the use and benefit of the charity children of Paddington.</p>
<p>This legacy was applied by Mr. Baron Maseres, together with
one hundred and twenty pounds, a year&rsquo;s rent of his own
estate in the parish, towards the building of the
school-room.</p>
<h4>Abourne&rsquo;s Charity.</h4>
<p>George Abourne, esq., by will, dated fifth August, 1767, gave,
after the death of certain persons therein named, the dividends
of three hundred pounds in the four per cent. consolidated bank
annuities, in meat and bread to as many poor families as might
have eight pounds of good beef and a half-peck loaf a-piece, to
be given twice a-year, every Michaelmas and every Lady-day, for
ever; and all the butchers and all the bakers of the place where
he should be buried, to take their turns in serving the meat and
bread.</p>
<p>This legacy is now three hundred pounds three per cent.
reduced annuities, standing in the name of the testator, George
Abourne.&nbsp; The dividends, nine pounds a year, are received by
Benjamin Edward Hall, esq., as executor of James Crompton, <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the surviving
executor of Benjamin Crompton, who was surviving executor of the
testator, George Abourne.&nbsp; Mr. Hall distributes the amount
annually, on the twenty-fourth of January, among poor persons of
the parish of Paddington, where Mr. Abourne was buried, by
tickets, each entitling the bearer to four pounds of meat and a
loaf of the same weight.&nbsp; The number of persons receiving
them varies according to circumstances; they are selected either
upon Mr. Hall&rsquo;s personal knowledge, or the recommendation
of respectable inhabitants; preference being generally given to
the most aged and infirm, or such as are encumbered with the
largest families. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Hall furnished us with a statement of the receipts and
expenditure from the time that the charity came into action in
1792, from which it appears that, one year with another, more has
been given than the amount of the dividends.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The poor of this parish owe much to Messrs. Robertson and
Parton for the trouble they took to preserve the memory of those
rights which remained at the time they accepted the office of
vestry-clerks.&nbsp; Had it not been for their exertions, I very
much question, judging from what had taken place and from the
state of affairs when they were appointed, whether anything
respecting these lands would have been known now; and there can
be no doubt but their &ldquo;account&rdquo; was a very imperfect
one.&nbsp; All those who were benefited by past peculation, would
studiously avoid giving these gentlemen the benefit of their
knowledge; and even now it is exceedingly difficult to obtain any
traditional information on this subject.&nbsp; One of the oldest
tenants of the charity-lands plainly said to me, with a blunt
honesty I could not but admire, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me,
Sir, but if I could tell you any thing, I
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have already mentioned my notions respecting the origin of
the term &ldquo;Bread and Cheese Lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tale
which is told, and which has hitherto been generally received, is
to be found in the London Magazine, for December,
1737:&mdash;&ldquo;Sunday, 18th, this day, according to annual
custom, bread and cheese were thrown from Paddington Steeple to
the populace, agreeably to the will of two women who were
relieved there with bread and cheese when they were almost
starved, and Providence afterwards favouring them, they left an
estate in that parish to continue the custom for ever on that
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This custom was continued down to about 1838; a single slice
of cheese and a penny loaf, being, at last, all that <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>was thrown;
the old method of dispensing alms having been found to be
anything but charitable alms&rsquo;-giving.&nbsp; The Sunday
before Christmas was, in fact, in the last century and beginning
of this, a sort of fair-day, for the sturdy vagabonds of London,
who came to Paddington to scramble over dead men&rsquo;s bones
for bread and cheese.</p>
<p>The dispute about <i>the half-acre</i> is settled, as I am
informed, by the bishop having established his right to it; and
the whole of the second portion of the bread and cheese lands,
mentioned in this Report, was sold to the Great Western Railway
Company for &pound;1,200.&nbsp; There remains, therefore, of this
charity-estate only a portion of the first, and the third
parcels, reported on by the Committee of the House of
Commons.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh of July, 1838, the first and second
Victoria, Chap. 32, &ldquo;An Act for enabling the trustees of
certain lands situate in the Parish of Paddington, in the county
of Middlesex, to grant building leases of the said lands and for
other purposes,&rdquo; confirmed an order of the Court of
Chancery relative to the appointment of trustees, and the
disposal of the proceeds of this freehold estate.&nbsp; By this
Act six trustees are appointed, and future appointments are to be
made by the vestry, whenever the number is reduced to three; and
to these, and their successors, power is given to grant building
leases.&nbsp; And after the payment of all costs and charges
relative to their trust, they are directed to &ldquo;pay and
apply the rents and profits arising from the said Charity
Estates, in manner following, that is to say, the same to be
divided into five equal parts, three-fifths thereof to be applied
towards the support of the Paddington Parochial National and
Infant Schools, for the instruction of boys and girls, children
of poor persons residing in the said parish of Paddington; one
other fifth-part towards apprenticing or instructing in business,
for their future support, boys and girls, the children of
parishioners of and not having received parochial relief from the
said parish; and the remaining one-fifth part in the distribution
of bread and cheese, coals, blankets, and other necessary
articles, at the discretion of the said trustees, for the benefit
of and amongst poor parishioners of the said parish not receiving
parochial relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the ninth section of this Act, the money paid into the
Court of Exchequer for that portion of the estate sold to the
Great Western Railway Company, was assigned to the application
for and expenses incurred in obtaining this Act.</p>
<p>The schedule which is annexed to this Act describes the <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>bread and
cheese lands, then claimed by the trustees, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All that piece of Garden Ground formerly
lying in the common field, called Bayswater field, containing
three roods, six perches, and three quarters, being in the
occupation of Thomas Hopgood, as a yearly tenant; and also all
that piece or parcel of Garden Ground, contiguous to the
above-mentioned piece of Garden Ground, containing one acre, two
roods, and fifteen perches, now in the occupation of Samuel
Cheese as yearly tenant; and also all that piece or parcel of
meadow-land, with a dwelling-house thereon, lying near Black Lion
Lane, containing one acre or thereabouts, now in the occupation,
of Robert Nevins, for a term of sixty-three years, from
Christmas, one thousand, eight hundred and two.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Messrs. Hopgood and Cheese are still the tenants of the land
north of the Uxbridge-road.&nbsp; The house and grounds, situated
&ldquo;near Black-lion lane,&rdquo; are now in the occupation of
Mr. G. P. Shapcott.</p>
<p>With respect to what Bishop Compton gave to the poor of this
parish, little appears to be known.&nbsp; The deed of gift cannot
be found; but from many circumstances, I am inclined to believe
it was the land on which the Alms&rsquo;-houses now stand, and
not that estate which is situated at the entrance of the
Harrow-road, for which the poor are indebted to this bishop.</p>
<p>The houses, described in the report under &ldquo;Dr.
Compton&rsquo;s charity,&rdquo; were pulled down ten or eleven
years ago, and the ground was let on building leases; six large
and handsome houses, including the public-house, were built on
the ground on which the old poor-house, &amp;c. stood; and, as I
have been informed, these houses pay to the trustees of the
charity-estate a ground rent averaging forty pounds per
house.&nbsp; By the cash accounts, it will be seen that the
&ldquo;Enfranchised Copyholds&rdquo; have for many years past
produced an annual income of upwards of five hundred
pounds.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Freehold rents&rdquo; appear from the
same accounts, to be seventy-one pounds and a few shillings per
annum. <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p>Of the trustees mentioned in the report as having been
admitted tenants in trust for the copyhold estates, in 1822, only
one, I believe, is now living.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Mrs.
Margaret Robertson&rsquo;s will is still existing, and to be seen
at Doctors&rsquo; Commons: it is dated sixteenth of December, and
not September.&nbsp; The messuage and garden which she gave,
appear to have joined the Red Lion, which was also in her
possession, and which she left to Mr. Gee.&nbsp; The will does
not express the donor&rsquo;s desire respecting the disposal of
her charity, excepting that it was &ldquo;for the use of the
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New leases have been granted for &ldquo;Margaret
Robertson&rsquo;s charity,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;Dr.
Compton&rsquo;s charity,&rdquo; by trustees appointed under an
order of the Court of Chancery.&nbsp; These charities are now
called &ldquo;The Enfranchised Copyhold Estate.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am
informed by the Rev. Mr. Campbell that the proceeds are applied
in the same manner as the rents of &ldquo;The Freehold
Estate,&rdquo; but that a separate trust exists.</p>
<p>I was very desirous to have ascertained the exact dimensions
of these separate estates, now held for the benefit of the poor
of this parish; but, unfortunately, on my application to the
trustees I found they had held their half-yearly meeting.&nbsp;
Lysons, writing in 1794 or 5, says, &ldquo;A benefaction of five
pounds per annum, given by Mrs. Margaret Robinson, for the
purpose of apprenticing poor children has been lost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This charity must not be mistaken for a donation of five pounds,
which is recorded on the panels in front of the gallery of St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>On the vestry minutes, I find two entries relative to the
copyhold charity-estates; one in October, 1800, the other in May,
1821.&nbsp; From the first entry, I learn that each of the said
premises therein described was held at a quit-rent of six-pence
per annum.&nbsp; The piece of ground belonging to the alms&rsquo;
houses is described as &ldquo;a piece of ground, formerly waste,
lying upon Paddington-green;&rdquo; having 80-feet of frontage,
and 90-feet of depth, which was increased by two other pieces;
one &ldquo;in front of the alms&rsquo; houses,&rdquo; 13-feet
10-inches in breadth, by 70-feet long.&nbsp; The other on the
east of the alms&rsquo; houses, 24-feet broad, by 113-feet
9-inches from north to south.&nbsp; If to this latter piece we
add that which was to be given up by the Grand Junction Canal
Company, (13-feet by 116 feet) we shall get at all that has been
known of the alms&rsquo;-house land during this century.</p>
<p>But these minutes shew there were other pieces of copyhold
formerly held in trust for the poor, which have
&ldquo;escheated&rdquo; into the lord&rsquo;s domain, or
&ldquo;merged&rdquo; into other private hands.</p>

THE PADDINGTON ESTATE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> policy which has raised the
manor and rectory of Paddington to its present value <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a>&mdash;three-quarters of a million
sterling; which has effectually transferred, (so far as private
Acts of Parliament can transfer,) two-thirds of the interest of
this &ldquo;small estate&rdquo; into private hands; and which at
the same time has kindly permitted the rate-payers of Paddington
to saddle themselves with almost the entire &ldquo;costs and
charges&rdquo; of those duties for which the whole of this estate
was originally designed, may be said to have had some show of a
<i>legalised</i> beginning exactly a century ago.</p>
<p>In 1753, Thomas (Sherlock), then bishop of London, and Sir
John Frederick, then lessee of the manor, were parties to an
agreement with the parishioners of Paddington; and procured for
them, or assisted in procuring, &ldquo;An Act for enlarging the
church-yard of the parish of Paddington, in the county of
Middlesex;&rdquo; which ratified that agreement.&nbsp; It had
been agreed, and was now enacted, that &ldquo;a certain piece or
parcel of ground, adjoining to the east side of the said
church-yard, containing from east to west, on the north side
thereof, ninety-six feet of assize; and from north to south, on
the east side thereof, one hundred and eighty four-feet of
assize; and from east to west, on the south side thereof, one
hundred and twenty-one feet of assize; and from north to south,
on the west side thereof, one hundred and thirty-two feet of
assize&rdquo; should &ldquo;be annexed to the present cemetery or
church-yard of the said parish of Paddington,&rdquo; for ever:
The churchwardens, or one of them, paying, after the
twenty-fourth of June, 1753, during the continuance of <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Sir John
Frederick&rsquo;s lease, &ldquo;unto the said Thomas, Lord Bishop
of London, and his successors, or to his or their proper officer
or agent for the time being, the annual rent or yearly sum of
forty shillings of lawful money of Great Britain, at or on the
feast-day of St. John the Baptist, in every year, during the
continuance of the said lease; and also to the said Sir John
Frederick, his heirs or assigns, the annual rent or yearly sum of
ten pounds of lawful money of Great Britain, at or on the
feast-day of Saint John the Baptist, in every year during the
continuance of the same lease; and from and after the expiration
of the said lease, to the said Thomas, Lord Bishop of London, and
his successors, and his and their grantees, the annual rent or
yearly sum of twelve pounds of lawful money of Great Britain, at
or on the feast-day of Saint John the Baptist in every year for
ever:&rdquo; the rent and all arrears being made recoverable by
action at law with full costs of suit. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>For defraying the expenses of this Act and enclosing the said
ground, the inhabitants were permitted to borrow a sum not
exceeding two hundred and fifty pounds at four per cent.
interest.</p>
<p>Sir John Frederick died in 1755, having made a will, dated
twenty-seventh of February, 1734, in which he leaves his estate
to his sons &ldquo;in tail male, remainder to the heirs male of
the testator&rsquo;s own body, remainder to his own right
heirs;&rdquo; and added a codicil, dated April tenth, 1742, in
which he notices that, since the making his said will, he had
purchased the site and capital messuage of the manor of
Paddington, held by lease for three lives from the Bishop of
London, and &ldquo;he thereby gave and demised the same to the
trustees, in his said will, their heirs and assigns, during the
lives of Judith Jodrell, John Affleck, and John Crozier the
younger, in the said lease named, and for the life of the longest
liver of them, upon trust, out of the rents and profits, to pay
the rent reserved by the said lease, and perform the
lessees&rsquo; covenants therein, and to renew the said lease as
occasion should require, and raise the fines and charges for such
renewals, and subject thereto, should stand seized of the said
leasehold premises, in <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>trust for such and the same person
and persons as should, from time to time, be entitled to his
freehold land of inheritance, by virtue of his said will or
codicils so far as the nature of the said leasehold premises
would admit, and by the rules of law and equity they
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eldest son, Sir John Frederick, held and enjoyed the same
during his life; and, as he died intestate and without issue, in
the month of March, 1757, it came to his second son, Sir Thomas
Frederick, who had two daughters.</p>
<p>In 1763, the third year of George the third, Richard,
(Osbaldeston), then Bishop of London, and Sir Thomas Frederick,
then lessee of the manor, agreed to &ldquo;An Act for vesting
certain parcels of land in Paddington, in the county of
Middlesex, in the Rector and Churchwardens of the parish of Saint
George, Hanover-square, in the said county, and appropriating the
same for a burial-ground for the said parish;&rdquo; by which
&ldquo;five acres or thereabouts, lying at the west-end of the
field called Tyburn Field,&rdquo; and a piece of waste, lying
between the highway leading from London to Uxbridge, and the said
field, were settled upon and vested in the rectors and
churchwardens of the said parish, for ever.&nbsp; These lands
being &ldquo;discharged from the uses in Sir John
Frederick&rsquo;s will, and annexed to the parish of St. George,
Hanover-square;&rdquo; and the life estate or interest in the
said five acres of ground having been purchased of Sir Thomas
Frederick, the churchwardens agreed, and were bound, to pay,
after the decease of Sir Thomas, fifteen pounds per annum to the
person or persons who shall be entitled to the site of the manor
of Paddington, and the rest of the said leasehold premises under
and by virtue of the will and codicils of the said Sir John
Frederick, &ldquo;during the present or any subsequent lease to
be granted thereof;&rdquo; and to &ldquo;the Bishop of London,
and his successors, during the time that the said site of the
said manor, and the rest of the said leasehold premises, shall
remain in the proper hands and possession of the said bishop, or
his successors, and not in lease, to or for the benefit of any
person or persons, claiming or to claim under or by virtue of the
will and codicils of the said Sir John Frederick, the clear
yearly sum of twenty-five pounds;&rdquo; and to &ldquo;the
churchwardens for the time being of the said Parish of
Paddington, for ever, the clear yearly sum of forty-shillings, in
lieu of all parochial rates, taxes, and assessments which may, or
otherwise might, be due and payable to the said parish of
Paddington for or in respect of the said intended burial-ground,
or <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the
lands therein to be contained.&rdquo;&nbsp; Actions are given to
the several parties for non-payment of these sums; the
churchwardens are to be allowed such payments; and the rector to
have the burial-fees.</p>
<p>In 1795, a private Act of Parliament, the 35th Geo. III, cap.
83, entitled &ldquo;An Act for enabling the Lord Bishop of London
to grant a lease with powers of renewal of lands in the parish of
Paddington, in the county of Middlesex; for the purpose of
building upon,&rdquo; received the sanction of the
legislature.</p>
<p>We are informed by the preamble of this Act, which occupies
thirty-two Act of Parliament pages, and recites wholly or in part
fifteen indentures; <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a> that on the fourth
of May, 1768, the manor and rectory were leased to Gascoigne
Frederick, his heirs and assigns, for three lives, and that in
consideration of the surrender of this lease, &ldquo;as also for
divers other good causes and valuable considerations him
thereunto specially moving,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Right honourable
and Reverend Father-in-God, Richard, <a name="citation75b"></a><a
href="#footnote75b" class="citation">[75b]</a> by Divine
permission, then Lord Bishop of London,&rdquo; granted unto the
aforesaid Gascoigne Frederick, of the Inner Temple, a new lease,
for three lives, bearing date the fourteenth of August, 1776.</p>
<p>We are further informed, that this Gascoigne Frederick died
intestate, leaving Mary Frederick, Elizabeth Snell, and Susannah
Frederick, all of Bampton, in the county of Oxford, his only
surviving sisters and co-heirs at law.&nbsp; We are also
informed, that in this lease of the fourteenth of August, 1776,
Gascoigne Frederick&rsquo;s &ldquo;name was made use of therein
only for the use and benefit of Elizabeth Frederick and Selina
Frederick,&rdquo; and that they, with their husbands, applied to
the ladies of Bampton to sell all the hereditaments and premises
demised to the said Gascoigne Frederick, in 1776; and which these
ladies kindly did for <i>ten shillings a-piece</i>, as is
witnessed by indentures, dated fifth and sixth of February, 1781,
which re-convey the said lease and leasehold premises to trustees
for the purposes mentioned in the will and codicil of Sir John
Frederick, and in the marriage-settlements of the granddaughters
of the aforesaid baronet.</p>
<p>By a &ldquo;fine sur concessit,&rdquo; levied in Trinity Term,
in the twenty-second year of George the third, &ldquo;in order to
dock, bar, and extinguish all estates, tail,&rdquo; &amp;c, this
estate was conveyed <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>to Thomas Lloyd and his heirs for the uses of the
trustees, in trust to be applied, one half according to the
marriage settlement of Elizabeth wife of John Morshead,
afterwards Sir John Morshead; the other half subject to the uses
of the marriage settlement of her sister Selina, wife of Robert
Thistlethwayte.</p>
<p>These indentures are dated respectively the fifth of July,
1782, and fourth of March, 1783.&nbsp; They are set forth, in
part, in the Act now under review; and as they were executed
during the minority of these ladies, there are also, as we may
suppose, references to sundry opinions, reports, orders, &amp;c.
of that very ancient Court of Equity, whose interesting
proceedings are so excellently depicted in &ldquo;Bleak
House,&rdquo; by the great teacher of our time.</p>
<p>By conveying these lay interests in this estate with other
interests in private property to trustees,&mdash;by charging the
whole with large sums of money,&mdash;by carrying the
&ldquo;remainder&rdquo; over a thousand years in one case, and in
the other one thousand five hundred;&mdash;by changing &ldquo;the
said leasehold premises from a freehold to a chattle
interest;&rdquo;&mdash;and then by making &ldquo;the tenure
thereof as nearly equal to freehold as possible;&rdquo;&mdash;and
by certain acts which we are about to examine, Gascoigne
Frederick&rsquo;s lease for three lives has been converted into
as snug and nice a little property, as any lady or gentleman in
the land need desire; provided always, it could be secured from
the anxious care of the ancient court before mentioned, and that
more modern tribunal, which will one day be instituted to examine
into the claims the public may have on such estates as this.</p>
<p>As the chief instruments in the formation of the Paddington
estate are those peculiar Acts of Parliament which have been
denominated &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; to distinguish them from
&ldquo;laws,&rdquo; it is from these chiefly that I shall gather
the <i>facts</i> contained in this chapter: and as this Act of
1795 is somewhat scarce, and as the preamble affords some
interesting information, I shall quote several passages from it
entire:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Purchase of Waste Lands</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And whereas there
are certain Pieces or Parcels or small narrow strips of Land,
containing in the whole about five acres, which lie as Waste or
Commonable Lands in the Lanes and Road-Ways dispersed in, about,
and within the said Parish of Paddington, and are contiguous to
and in front of some of the said Lanes, Hereditaments, and
Premises comprised in the said lease, between the Hedge Rows of
the same Lands and the different Road and Carriage Ways <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>leading to,
from and through the said parish, as the public highways thereof,
and which have been used by the tenants of the said lessees for
the purpose chiefly of laying Dung Heaps thereon, and the same
are become a great nuisance, not only to the said Parishioners,
but to the Public at large, and which nuisance would not only
considerably increase if the same Lands were to remain open and
unenclosed in their present state, to the great annoyance of the
said Public and Parish at large, but would greatly impede the
good purposes of this Act; and therefore it is proposed by the
said Lord Bishop and his said Lessees, that the said Waste Lands
should be annexed to and become a Part of the said Hereditaments
and Premises so to be demised under the powers of this Act, and
that such Compensation shall be made to the said Parish at large
for any Interest they may claim therein for the benefit of the
said Parish, by way of a Rent Charge, to be paid to the
Churchwardens of the said Parish for the Time being for ever, for
enclosing the same as is hereinafter provided for, and annexing
the same to the said Hereditaments and Premises, discharged of
and from any Common Right or Claim, if any such did
exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Contemplated Destruction of Parsonage and other
Souses</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And whereas some few Farm Houses and
Messuages have many years since been erected, and are now
standing on Part of the said demised Premises, but the same with
the Out Buildings are now become very ancient and much out of
repair, and in some respects so very ruinous as to be incapable
of being repaired; and a variety of other small and temporary
Buildings of Lath and Plaster, and of a very inferior quality,
have also been lately erected and built, and now are erecting and
building thereon, and which by means of the Persons who inhabit
therein may become a great Burthen to the said Parish in the
increase of their Poor Rates, but the principal Part of the said
Ground demised by the said Indenture of Lease of the fourteenth
day of August, 1776, still lies open and unbuilt upon, and on
account of its vicinity to London, the whole is capable of very
great and capital improvement, and if such Improvements were made
would render a very large Increase of Rent, as well to the said
Lessees and their Heirs and Assigns, as to the said Lord Bishop
and his Successors for the Time being, but by reason of the
nature of the present Tenure such Improvements cannot be
effected, and therefore in order to induce Builders and other
Persons to take the same and build capital Houses and Squares
thereon, it is <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>thought necessary that the Tenure thereof should be made
in value as nearly equal to Freehold as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Nature of the Lease to be Changed</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And
whereas it would be greatly for the Benefit and Advantage of the
said Lord Bishop of London and of his Successors, and of the said
Sir John Morshead and Dame Elizabeth, his wife, and their Issue,
(instead of granting Leases for Lives as has been usual and
customary on Fines paid for the same) if a power was given to the
said Lord Bishop and his Successors to grant a new Lease of the
said Premisses comprised in the said Lease of the fourteenth day
of August, 1776, together with the said Strips of Waste Land
within the said Parish of Paddington, for such Terms of Years,
and with such Powers of Renewal as are hereafter mentioned, and
particularly with a power for the Lessees therein to grant Under
Leases thereof, at such Rents, and under such restrictions, and
in such manner as is hereinafter expressed with respect to such
Original and Under Leases respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Division of Profits</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And whereas the value
of the Interests of the said Lord Bishop of London and his
successors and of the said Lessees in the said Premises, having
been taken into consideration, it is conceived that the Rents,
Issues and Profits which at present are reserved or payable, or
which shall or may arise from and out of the Messuages, Lands,
Hereditaments, and Premises comprised in the said Lease, or which
shall hereafter be reserved or payable, or arise from and out of
the said Premises, and every part thereof, upon any reserved
Lease or Leases to be made under the authority of this Act, or
any Under Leases in pursuance thereof or otherwise, should be
appropriated between the said Bishop of London and his said
Lessees in the shares hereinafter mentioned, (that is to say),
One Third thereof to the Bishop and his Successors for the Time
being, and Two Thirds thereof to his said Lessees, their
Executors, Administrators, or Assigns, subject to the said
present Annual Rents and Pension, and such other Deductions as
are hereinafter mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Increase of Forty Pounds a year in the Stipend of a Single
Curate</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And whereas the said clear yearly
pension or stipend of Eighty Pounds, so payable to the Curate of
the said Parish of Paddington for the time being, who is
appointed to serve the said Cure by the said Lord Bishop and his
Successors, and which now stands charged upon the whole of the
said Hereditaments and Premises so comprised in the said Lease of
the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>fourteenth day of August, 1776, and which it is proposed
should be by the said intended Lease or Leases so to be granted
under the powers of this Act, increased to &pound;120 a-year, and
be secured upon and made payable, not only out of the Tythes
arising and to arise and become payable to the said Lessees, as
hereinafter is mentioned, but also upon a Farm and Lands called
Kilburn Bridge Farm hereinafter mentioned, and now of the annual
value of &pound;230, and now in the occupation of &mdash;
Newport, as Tenant thereof at such Rent, and not be charged or
become chargeable upon any other part of the said Lands,
Hereditaments, and Premises to be leased by any such Under Lease
or Under Leases for the purposes intended by this Act, in which
case it would defeat the good purposes of this Act.</p>
<p><i>Sole benefit of contemplated change</i>, <i>with the
exceptions above mentioned</i>, <i>to be for the Bishop and his
Lessees</i>.&mdash;And whereas, notwithstanding it would be for
the mutual benefit of the said Lord Bishop of London and his
successors, and the said Sir John Morshead and Dame Elizabeth his
Wife and their infant issue, and the said Robert Thistlethwayte
and Selina his Wife and their Infant issue as aforesaid, that the
said herein-before mentioned Proposals should be carried into
complete Execution, yet the same cannot be effected without the
aid of Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherefore His Majesty&rsquo;s most dutiful and loyal subjects,
Beilby (Porteus) Lord Bishop of London, on behalf of himself and
his successors, Thomas Wood, (the surviving Trustee of the
marriage settlements of the under-mentioned ladies,) Sir John
Morshead and Dame Elizabeth his Wife, on behalf of themselves and
their six children, Robert Thistlethwayte and Selina his Wife, on
behalf of themselves and their six children, and Sir John
Frederick and Arthur Stanhope (new trustees appointed under the
provisions of the aforesaid marriage settlements) joined in
beseeching his Majesty that it might be enacted, and it was
enacted, in the usual form: &ldquo;That it shall and may be
lawful to and for the said Beilby, Lord Bishop of London, and his
successors for the time being, and he and they are hereby
required and directed by Indenture under the Episcopal Seal of
the said Lord Bishop, and his successors, to demise, lease, and
to farm let&rdquo; to the said trustees &ldquo;their Executors,
Administrators, or Assigns, or the Trustees or Trustee for the
time being, to be hereafter named or appointed under the
Powers&rdquo; of Indentures of settlement of the 5th of July,
1782, and 4th of March, 1783, partly recited in this Act, all the
&ldquo;Hereditaments whatsoever of the <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>said Reverend Father, and belonging
to the bishoprick of London, heretofore demised by the late King
Henry the eighth,&rdquo; by an Indenture dated 21st of December,
in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, to Richard Rede;
&ldquo;and also all that Annual Rent or yearly sum of Ten Pounds,
charged upon the Parish of Paddington;&rdquo; &ldquo;and also all
that Wood and Wood Ground commonly called Paddington Wood,
containing by estimation Thirty Acres, be it more or less, and
which was many years since converted into and is now Pasture
Land, together with all manner of Trees, Hawts and Hedgerows of
the said Reverend Father, and belonging to the said Bishoprick of
London, growing or being, or which hereafter shall grow or be
within the Parish of Paddington aforesaid, and also all the
Herbage and Pannage of the said Woods, &amp;c. &amp;c.,&rdquo;
&ldquo;and all other the Hereditaments and Premises&rdquo; leased
and comprised in an Indenture, dated the fourteenth of August,
1776, also partly recited in this Act, &ldquo;except Easter
Offerings, Mortuaries, and all surplice fees to be paid to and
received by the Curate of Paddington for the time being;&rdquo;
and also all and singular the strips or pieces or parcels of
waste ground herein-before described &ldquo;containing about five
acres, be the same more or less;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To hold for
a term of ninety-nine years, and to commence from the day next
before the day of the date of such lease,&rdquo; and also to
renew the said lease at the end of the first fifty years of the
said term of ninety-nine years, on payment or tender of a fine of
twenty shillings, for a further term of ninety-nine years, to
commence and be computed from the end of the said first fifty
years, and so to continue to renew the lease for the time being
so to be granted.&rdquo; <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>The Act provides &ldquo;That before the Execution of the said
first Indenture of Lease, or of any Indenture of Renewal, and at
the end of every year afterwards there shall be delivered by the
Lessees therein to be named to the said Bishop and his
successors, or his or their Agent or Steward, a true and
particular account, in writing, of the Rent or Rents, at which
the Premises thereby to be leased, are then let or demised, and
to whom, and for what term or number of years
respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Act also provides &ldquo;that there be reserved in such
Lease and renewed Leases a chief rent chargeable on the said
Lands, Tenements, &amp;c.,&rdquo; &ldquo;for the benefit of the
said Lord Bishop of London and his successors for the time being,
of forty-three <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>pounds, six shillings and eightpence, and also one-third
part of the rents, issues, ground-rents, and other profits
reserved or to be reserved, due and payable, or arising out or
from, or which the same Messuages or Tenements, Lands, Tythes,
Hereditaments, and Premises, and every part thereof shall be let
for, immediately before the passing of this Act, and which the
same shall from time to time be let for, under the leases to be
granted as hereinafter is mentioned, or otherwise, after
deducting in the first place the above-mentioned reserved rent of
forty-three pounds, six shillings and eight-pence,&rdquo; a
pension to the curate of &pound;120 a-year, the fifteen pounds a
year rent paid to the Churchwardens for the waste lands, the land
tax, &ldquo;and such other taxes as shall or may be hereafter
imposed on the Lessor or Landlord in respect of the said Premises
by authority of Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such reserved rents to
be paid quarterly &ldquo;and the first payment thereon to
commence, to the said Lord Bishop and his successors, from the
fifth day of April last past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was also provided that the aforesaid pension or annual
stipend of &pound;120, payable to the curate, should be secured
on and made payable from the tithes of the Parish of Paddington,
also on &ldquo;a farm, called Kilburn Bridge Farm, containing
about forty acres or thereabouts, and of the yearly value of
&pound;230.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was also provided, that the lease now
to be granted or any renewed lease should contain such or the
like covenants as are mentioned and contained in the Indenture of
the fourteenth of August, 1776, &ldquo;touching the accommodation
of the Surveyor or Steward of the said Lord Bishop and his
successors, their servants and horses, on any court or courts,
survey or surveys to be held of or for the said
Premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided always, that there be a covenant inserted in
such Lease and Leases so to be granted as aforesaid, that the
said Thomas Wood, Sir John Frederick, and Arthur Stanhope, their
Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, or any succeeding Trustee
or Trustees to be appointed as aforesaid, their or his Executors,
Administrators, or Assigns shall not lease or demise any part of
the said Hereditaments and Premises to be comprised in the Leases
so to be granted to them as aforesaid, except in the manner
hereinafter mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A power was given to the said Trustees or their Assigns to
demise any part of the said premises comprised in the lease and
leases to be granted by the bishop and his successors, &ldquo;not
exceeding two hundred acres thereof,&rdquo; without application
to <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Parliament for farther powers, &ldquo;to any person or
persons who shall be willing to build upon, rebuild, or
substantially repair the same, in the manner by the Lease or
respective Leases to be granted thereof to be specified,&rdquo;
for any term not exceeding ninety-eight years (&ldquo;provided
that the said Lord Bishop for the time being be a party to all
such Under Leases,&rdquo;) &ldquo;so as there be reserved in and
by such Leases, &amp;c. the best and most improved yearly rent
that can be reasonably had or gotten for the same, to be made
payable quarterly, free from all deductions whatsoever, without
any Pine, Premium, or Foregift, or any Thing in the nature of a
Fine being taken for the making thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leases were to contain covenants to build and keep in
repair the messuages, &amp;c. agreed to be built, and to keep
these buildings &ldquo;insured from damage by fire to the amount
of four-fifths of the value thereof;&rdquo; and &ldquo;to
surrender and leave in repair the messuages, &amp;c. to be
erected and built, or rebuilt and repaired&rdquo; at the end of
the term or terms in such leases granted.&nbsp; And all
&ldquo;other usual and proper covenants, provisos, and
conditions&rdquo; were to be inserted &ldquo;usually contained in
building leases near the City of London.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
under-lettings were to take place from time to time by public
auction to the best bidder, (if approved of by the bishop and his
lessees), notice of the time and place of such auction having
been given to the bishop or his agent by the said lessees.&nbsp;
Separate lots were to be made for every house, &ldquo;whose
breadth in front shall be twenty-eight feet and upwards;&rdquo;
and for houses of smaller dimensions no more than one hundred
feet frontage was to be let in one lot.&nbsp; The under-lessees
were to be bound to build on this land, so taken, within a
specified time, &ldquo;and agreeably to such a plan as shall be
approved by the Lord Bishop of London and his successors, and the
said lessees for the time being.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three counterparts
of these under-leases were to be provided, one to be delivered to
the bishop or his agent, for the registration of which a fee of
six shillings and eight pence was to be paid; the other two being
for the trustees of the two families interested in the
Bishop&rsquo;s lease.&nbsp; Any number of these sub-leases might
be taken by any one person, so that the quantity altogether did
not amount &ldquo;to more than fifteen acres of the said
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was also provided, that &ldquo;Farm Leases
at Rack-rent for twenty-one years may be granted with the consent
of the Bishop of London,&rdquo; but to be determinable on six
months&rsquo; notice being given.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>The
patronage of the Church of Paddington was reserved to the
Bishop.&nbsp; The trustees were to stand possessed of the new
lease on leases to be granted by the Bishop, in trust, one half
for the person and persons, &amp;c. to whom the same ought to go
or belong by virtue of the Indenture of Release of the fifth of
July, 1782; the other half in trust for the person and persons,
&amp;c. entitled by virtue of the Indenture, dated fourth of
March, 1783; certain new provisions having been necessary in
consequence of the change of interests.</p>
<p>The trustees were not to make any leases under the authority
of this Act, without the consent in writing of Sir John and Lady
Morshead, and Mr. and Mrs. Thistlethwayte.</p>
<p>And this Act was not to prevent the Bishop and his Lessees
from treating with the Grand Junction Canal Proprietors
&ldquo;for such part or parts of the said premises, over and
above the number of acres hereinbefore limited for building
on;&rdquo; neither did it do so; for by &ldquo;An Act for making
a Navigable Cut from the Grand Junction Canal, in the precinct of
Norwood, in the county of Middlesex, to Paddington, in the said
county,&rdquo; passed in the same year as the preceding, the 35th
Geo. III, cap. 43, we find that although the cut was not to be
made through the Paddington Estate without the consent of owners
yet that consent had already been given as to certain lands at
Westbourn-green; and in 1798, by an Act for confirming and
carrying into execution certain articles of Agreement made and
entered into between Beilby, Lord Bishop of London, the Lessees
of the Paddington Estate, and the Company of Proprietors of the
Grand Junction Canal, &ldquo;and for other purposes therein
mentioned&rdquo;&mdash;the 38th Geo. III, cap. 33.&mdash;we find
that the said Company had then entered into a covenant with the
said Lord Bishop, and his lessees, for certain other Pieces or
Parcels of Land lying in the Parish of Paddington, amounting in
the whole to &ldquo;Forty Acres, Two Roods and Thirty-seven
Perches,&rdquo; at a yearly rent of &pound;814 12<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> being at the rate of twenty pounds per annum per acre;
also certain other Pieces or Parcels, all in the aforesaid Act
particularly set forth, <a name="citation83"></a><a
href="#footnote83" class="citation">[83]</a> amounting in the
whole to &ldquo;Seven Acres and Two Roods,&rdquo; at a yearly
rent of thirty-nine pounds, seven shillings and six-pence, being
after the rate of five pounds per acre per annum: in addition to
which the Company agreed to pay a further rent of thirty pounds
per annum, in respect of Buildings standing on the ground agreed
to be demised: and this annual sum of &pound;884 was agreed to be
paid &ldquo;by the said <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Company of Proprietors, their
successors and assigns, free and clear of all manner of taxes,
and from all other deductions and outgoings whatsoever:&rdquo;
one-third part to be paid to the said Lord Bishop and his
successors, and the remaining two-thirds to the trustees, as
lessees of the said estate.&nbsp; What good and valuable
consideration, over and above the rent specified, was given to
the Bishop and his lessees to induce them to consent to lease
this land for ninety-nine years, bating one day; and to agree,
for themselves and their successors, to renew the lease every
fifty years for the same term, on the tender of a fine of twenty
shillings, I cannot tell.&nbsp; These holders of the land, in all
probability, had a less exalted notion of its value than their
successors have had, but still it is very probable <i>some</i>
compensation was given to induce them to part with it at such a
rent.</p>
<p>Nine years after the passing of the Bishop&rsquo;s first
Building Act, it was found that it required &ldquo;altering and
amending,&rdquo; and the 44th Geo. III. cap. 63, was passed for
that purpose; &ldquo;and for granting further powers, the better
to carry into execution the purposes of the said Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this Act, two new trustees, Frederick Treise Morshead,
eldest son of Sir John and Lady Morshead, and Henry Frederick
Thistlethwayte, son of Sir Robert and Selina Thistlethwayte, were
appointed in the place of Thomas Wood, deceased.&nbsp; And we are
informed that those parts of the first Act which limited the
letting to public auction only, and required, in the leases for
twenty-one years, the insertion of a notice that the occupancy
might be terminated after any six months thereof, were
&ldquo;found to be very prejudicial to the interests of the
parties interested in the said estate, and a great check to the
future improvement thereof,&rdquo; and it was thought that it
would &ldquo;tend greatly to the advantage of the See of London,
and the other parties interested in the said estate,&rdquo; if
further powers were given.&nbsp; These clauses of the aforesaid
Act were, therefore, repealed, and in lieu thereof, the lessees
or lessee of the Bishop, with his previous consent first had and
obtained in writing, were allowed to treat, by private contract,
or otherwise, with any person or persons, willing to build on
this land, for the whole or any part of the two hundred acres in
the previous Act mentioned to be let for building upon, for any
term not exceeding ninety-nine years.</p>
<p>The previous Act limited the use of the brick-clay, gravel,
&amp;c. which were dug out of this estate, to the improvement of
the premises whereon these were found, but to no other purpose;
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>but it was
now declared, that &ldquo;for as much as it will tend greatly to
the Improvement of the said Estate, to raise a Fund for the
purpose of making main drains, forming and paving streets,
forming and gravelling roads, making bridges, and erecting bridge
ways for the improvement of the said estate,&rdquo; it should now
be enacted, that these materials might be sold to form a fund for
carrying out these objects, &ldquo;and for the general
improvement of the said estate.&rdquo; <a
name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a></p>
<p>Provision was made by this Act for the redemption of the land
tax, which was charged at &pound;132 per annum, the consideration
for which is stated to have been &pound;4,840 capital stock in
the three per cents.&nbsp; This was bought for &pound;3,075
0<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, by the sale of 4A. 1R. 36&frac12;P. which
brought in &pound;3,653 4<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, the expenses
thereon being &pound;64 11<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> <a
name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a></p>
<p>In 1805, another Act of Parliament relative to the Paddington
estate, the 45th Geo. III. cap. 113, became the law of the land,
and &ldquo;all judges, justices, and others&rdquo; were directed
to admit, as evidence, printed copies thereof; but as this Act
can be obtained in the usual way, my notice of it will be very
brief.&nbsp; It recites in part the two preceding Acts; states
that &ldquo;considerable progress has been made for carrying into
execution the said Acts;&rdquo; and attempts to remove
&ldquo;doubts which have arisen whether the trustees of the
original lease for the time being, though with the consent of the
said Lord Bishop, (Beilby, still bishop of London), or his
successors, have a power under the said Acts, or either of them,
to enter into contracts for granting building leases at a rent to
be specified in the contract, payable for the whole ground agreed
to be demised; and afterwards, as the houses or buildings shall
be completed or covered in, to grant separate leases of such
houses or buildings, at separate rents, amounting in the whole to
the rent originally contracted for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which mode of
contracting, we are told, &ldquo;is by experience found to be a
necessary preliminary to the granting of any such
Lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Act therefore declares that the lessees or lessee of the
Bishop for the time being, with his consent, may contract and
agree, to demise, lease, or grant any part of the premises to be
let, (but not exceeding the two hundred acres agreed to be let by
the first Act,) and afterwards grant separate leases under
certain conditions; one of which is that if the ground-rent of <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>any one house
exceed &ldquo;an equal proportion of the original rent agreed to
be reserved for the whole of the land or ground comprised in the
contract,&rdquo; it shall &ldquo;not exceed one-seventh part of
the clear yearly rack-rent or value of the land and buildings to
be by such lease demised, <a name="citation86a"></a><a
href="#footnote86a" class="citation">[86a]</a> so that the yearly
rent to be reserved by any Lease to be granted in pursuance of
this Act, be not in any case less than Forty Shillings:&rdquo;
&ldquo;the Bishop of London for the time being to be a party to
all such Leases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second clause of this Act provides that a memorial of
every lease, and also of every contract, shall be registered at
the public Office for registering Deeds and Conveyances, as
prescribed by the seventh of Anne; and that every such memorial
shall contain a full description of the land, the term of years
for which it was let, and the yearly rent or rents reserved
thereon. <a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a></p>
<p>Sir John Morshead being at this time absent from the kingdom,
&ldquo;and restrained from returning to the same by His
Majesty&rsquo;s enemies,&rdquo; certain clauses are enacted
respecting his consent being obtained, before leases are
granted.</p>
<p>In 1808, another Act &ldquo;for altering and enlarging the
powers&rdquo; of the 35th. 44th. and 45th. of George III. appears
to have become necessary; for in that year we have the 48th Geo.
III. cap. 142, passed for this purpose.</p>
<p>The preamble of this Act notices an Indenture of Assignment,
bearing date on or about the twenty-fourth of July, 1807, made
between Eliza Mary Thistlethwayte, widow of Alexander
Thistlethwayte, on the one part, and Thomas Thistlethwayte, her
brother-in-law, the third, but eldest surviving son of Robert
Thistlethwayte, on the other, wherein it is witnessed that,
&ldquo;for the consideration therein expressed,&rdquo; the said
lady assigned her interest in the Paddington Estate to the said
Thomas Thistlethwayte, his executors, &amp;c. &ldquo;for his and
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>their own
use and benefit absolutely;&rdquo; subject to the life interest
of his mother, then Selina Thistlethwayte. <a
name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a></p>
<p>By this Act certain parts of previous Acts are repealed; power
is given to the lessees to pull down all buildings standing upon
the premises comprised in any under-lease; the Bishop&rsquo;s
chief rent of forty-three pounds, six shillings and eightpence,
is no longer to be charged on the whole of the hereditaments and
premises; all lands comprised in the under-leases, to be
exonerated and indemnified from the payment of the same; and the
signatures of Sir John Morshead, Robert Thistlethwayte, and their
wives, to the under-leases are to be no longer necessary.&nbsp;
The sale of brick-earth, sand, gravel, &amp;c., having been found
totally inadequate for payment of costs of Acts, making drains,
streets, &amp;c. <a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b"
class="citation">[87b]</a>&nbsp; Beilby Lord Bishop of London <a
name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c"
class="citation">[87c]</a> and the trustees of the estate agree
to execute a mortgage of &ldquo;a competent part of the said
premises,&rdquo; charging it with any sum not exceeding ten
thousand pounds, with lawful interest, for these purposes; or the
money may be raised by annuities for lives instead of
mortgage.</p>
<p>The eighth section of this Act relates to the &ldquo;conduit
upon the said estate belonging to the corporation of London,
situate near Bayswater, and the pipes or drain therefrom, and the
tanks or wells connected therewith.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is stated
that as these pipes &ldquo;run through the same estate diagonally
so as to intercept the carrying on of the building improvements
upon any eligible plan,&rdquo; the Bishop and his lessees were
empowered to treat with the mayor and commonalty and citizens of
the said city of London, for the removal or varying the line of
the said pipes, &amp;c., and to make satisfaction for all damages
which may be sustained by the city in consequence thereof: the
estate to be charged with any sum not exceeding two thousand
pounds for effecting this object.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Provision is made in the tenth section&mdash;&ldquo;That
nothing herein contained shall extend, or be constructed to
extend, to authorize the making or forming any new drain or
drains, tunnel or tunnels, except for the conveying and receiving
the water from the conduit as aforesaid, which shall or may run
into the Park, called Hyde Park, or Kensington Gardens, or into
any drain, &amp;c., running into or communicating with the same
places, or either of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the rights, powers
and authorities, vested in the Commissioners of Sewers, were not
to be affected by this Act.</p>
<p>In a schedule to this Act annexed, signed S. P. Cockerell, we
find the &ldquo;estimate of the expence of building a main drain
or sewer for carrying off the water from the estate being at
least, five thousand three hundred feet in length, four feet
clear breadth,&rdquo; was ten thousand and sixty-four
pounds.&nbsp; And the &ldquo;estimate of the expence of moving
the pipes and drains from the conduit at Bayswater, and the tanks
and wells connected therewith,&rdquo; was two thousand
pounds.&nbsp; Yet this arrangement, with respect to the Bayswater
conduit and the pipes, &amp;c., proceeding therefrom, was not
sufficient to satisfy the owners of the Paddington estate; for,
in four years after it was made, another Act was passed &ldquo;to
enable the mayor and commonalty and citizens of the city of
London to sell, and the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of London
and his lessees of the estate at Paddington belonging to the See
of London to purchase, certain waters and springs and the
conduits and other appurtenances thereto within the several
parishes of Mary-le-bone and Paddington, in the county of
Middlesex.&rdquo;&nbsp; 52nd Geo. III. cap. 193.&nbsp; And
articles of agreement dated the first of July, 1812, relative to
the purchase of the said conduit, springs, &amp;c., for the sum
of two thousand five hundred pounds, are confirmed by this
Act.&nbsp; It also empowers John (Randolph) Lord Bishop of
London, and his successors for the time being, with consent of
the lessees, to raise money &ldquo;for the completion of the said
purchase and payment of the incidental expenses;&rdquo; either by
sale of all or any portion of thirty-two acres of land
particularly described in a schedule to this Act annexed; or by a
mortgage on any portion of the estate; or by annuities; but the
sum of money &ldquo;which may be raised under or by virtue of
all, any, or either of the provisions contained in this Act,
shall not together and in the whole exceed the sum of four
thousand five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are informed by a schedule attached to the 6th Geo. IV. cap
45. that under the powers of this Act, eight acres, one <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>rood, and
nineteen perches of land, were sold to purchase these waters; the
amount received for which, including &ldquo;interest and auction
duty,&rdquo; was two thousand, nine hundred and nineteen pounds,
sixteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
<p>The lands, described in the schedule annexed to this Act, are
said to be &ldquo;the most convenient for sale,&rdquo; being
&ldquo;detached parts&rdquo; of the estate.&nbsp; How there came
to be any &ldquo;detached parts&rdquo; in so snug an estate, the
Act does not inform us.&nbsp; But it does tell us that in these
detached parts there are two closes of land called &ldquo;The
Lower Readings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Upper Readings,&rdquo;
names very significant in themselves, and which must, I think, at
some time, have had some connection with Readers.</p>
<p>Another Act&mdash;the Regent&rsquo;s Canal Bill&mdash;was the
same day added to the list of those Acts which, together, have
made the Paddington Estate a subject of such notoriety.&nbsp; But
there was an Act also for each of the intervening years.</p>
<p>In 1810 &ldquo;An Act for further enlarging the Church-yard of
the parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex,&rdquo; the
50th Geo. III. cap. 44, enabled the trustees appointed under
previous Acts, relative to the church and church-yard, to charge
the burial-fees, pew-rents, and church-rates, with a sum not
exceeding two thousand five hundred pounds, in order to complete
a purchase of two acres, one rood and twenty-nine perches of land
belonging to the said John, Bishop of London, and his
lessees.&nbsp; For this piece of ground, with the trees standing
thereon, and the old manor-house, the parish paid two thousand,
two hundred and sixty-three pounds, seven shillings and
sixpence.&nbsp; This sum I presume was divided in the usual
proportion between the Bishop and his lessees: for this does not
appear to have been any part of the land authorised to be sold
for the purposes mentioned in one of the preceding Acts.</p>
<p>In 1811, the fifty-first of Geo. III. cap. 169, established
the Grand Junction Water Works Company; the thirty-third section
of which Act confirms and ratifies a previous arrangement, made
by the previous Bishop, Beilby Porteus, with the Grand Junction
Canal Company, for the supply of the tenants on the Paddington
estate, with water at ten pounds per cent. less than they could
be supplied by others.&nbsp; The clause is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Provided also</i>, <i>and be it farther
enacted</i>, <i>that the said Company of Proprietors shall</i>,
<i>and they are hereby required from Time to Time</i>, <i>and at
all times hereafter</i>, <i>to supply the several Lessees or
Tenants of the Estate belonging to the See of the Bishop </i><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span><i>of London
at Paddington aforesaid with Water</i>, <i>at the Rate of Ten
Pounds per Centum at the least below the average Rate which shall
be demanded and taken by the said Company</i>, <i>or any other
Company or Companies</i>, <i>for supplying with an equal quantity
of Water the Inhabitants of Souses of the like Magnitude and
Description of any other of the Districts or Streets within the
Cities of London and Westminster</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the tenants of the Paddington estate have, up
to this time, received the full benefits of this important
clause, I leave them to decide for themselves.&nbsp; I, for one,
can say that I have not; and after a full investigation of this
subject, I cannot undertake, (as I have been requested to do, by
a gentleman very much interested in the Company,) to point out
the injustice of this clause.&nbsp; I make no doubt this clause
was well considered, before it was allowed to form a portion of
this Act; and was taken by the bishop and his lessees as a part
of the <i>quid pro quo</i> in their arrangements with the
Company.</p>
<p>Whether it was done as an act of kindness to the tenants, as a
compensation for the loss of the public watering places which
existed on several parts of this estate, or to increase the value
of the estate matters little to our purpose: but we cannot
suppose that a public Company would have consented to this clause
without some adequate consideration; and even if the value of
this consideration is no longer felt, which I believe is not the
case, <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> that is no reason why their obligation
should not remain.&nbsp; To have had a tall chimney, with all its
consequences, as well as some acres of reservoirs filled with
water, standing for years in the centre of the parish, could have
been no improvement to the surrounding property, though the
convenience to the company must have been very great; and if any
injustice is to be discovered in this clause, I think it must be
found in confirming the benefit to a portion of the parish
only.&nbsp; But if the Company at that time had seen any
injustice in this arrangement, it could and most probably would
soon have been altered, for &ldquo;the aid and authority of
Parliament,&rdquo; was required in 1812, the very year after the
passing of this Water Company&rsquo;s Act, to make &ldquo;valid,
binding, and conclusive,&rdquo; certain articles of agreement,
dated the twenty-fourth of March, which were entered into between
John, then Bishop of London, and his lessees, and the company of
proprietors of <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>the Grand Junction Canal; which agreement, amongst other
things, was entered into, to enable the latter to lease to the
Grand Junction Water Works Company, the requisite quantity of
land for the completion of their works. <a
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>After fifteen years, in the seventh of Geo. IV, cap. 140, the
same clause is again to be found; and in the seventh and eighth
of Victoria, cap. 30, this agreement for supplying cheap water to
the tenants of the Paddington estate is again ratified and
confirmed; so that the subject has been well considered and ought
to be fully enforced by a co-operation of the tenants.</p>
<p>By the fifty-second Geo. III, cap. 192, the Act just referred
to, anno 1812, the said articles of agreement are
&ldquo;absolutely ratified, confirmed, and established,&rdquo; by
which thirty-six acres, three and a-half perches of land are
demised to the end of the term for which the land previously
leased to this Company was let, renewable for a further term of
ninety-nine years, every fifty years, on the tender of a fine of
twenty shillings, at a rent commencing at &pound;427 3<i>s.</i>
in 1812, and advancing year by year to 1818, when the annual rent
was fixed at &pound;570 3<i>s.</i>; one-third part of which was
to be paid to the Bishop of London for the time being, the other
two-thirds to his lessees.</p>
<p>Besides this lease of fresh portions of the estate, certain
small pieces were exchanged, and the Company reconveyed to the
bishop and his lessees rather more than two acres of that which
had been previously leased to them, so that, altogether, rather
more than eighty-two acres of the Paddington Estate is leased to
the Grand Junction Canal Company, at a rent of &pound;1,454
3<i>s.</i> per annum.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1812, the fifty-second of Geo. III. cap.
195, incorporated the Regent&rsquo;s Canal Company, and gave full
power and authority to that Company, &ldquo;to make and maintain
a Navigable Canal from the Grand Junction Canal, in the parish of
Paddington to the River Thames in the parish of Limehouse;&rdquo;
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>to supply
the same, as well as steam engines, Reservoirs, &amp;c. with
water from the River, and to effect other objects therein set
down.&nbsp; The land required of the Paddington Estate for making
this Canal amounted to two acres, three roods, twenty-eight
perches; the purchase money for which was &pound;2,000.</p>
<p>This canal was opened from Paddington to the Regent&rsquo;s
Park Basin two years after this Act passed, but was not finished
till August, 1820.&nbsp; The other Canal and Water Company Acts
which affect the Paddington Estate, are the fifty-sixth of Geo.
III. cap. 4 and 85; the fifty-ninth Geo. III. cap. 3; and the
seventh Geo. IV. cap. 140.&nbsp; But it appears that one Act of
Parliament was not sufficient to ratify and confirm the articles
of agreement of the twenty-fourth of March, 1812; for the fifth
of Geo. IV. cap. 35, passed in 1824, was called into operation
&ldquo;to carry into complete effect&rdquo; these articles of
agreement; and the twenty-six pages of which this Act is made up,
shew pretty clearly that &ldquo;some doubt&rdquo; must have been
entertained whether the things therein agreed to be done, could
be &ldquo;legally and effectually&rdquo; done.</p>
<p>After setting forth the title of those claiming the Paddington
Estate at this time, (1824,) the Act renders it lawful for
William (Howley) Bishop of London, and his successors, and their
lessees, and further requires and directs him and them to ratify
and confirm to the said Company all the parcels of land mentioned
in the said articles of agreement.</p>
<p>This Act informs us, too, of a field called &ldquo;Lower
Field,&rdquo; containing ten acres thirty-eight perches, which
was purchased or agreed to be purchased, by the Grand Junction
Canal Company, of James Crompton, esq., in 1801, but which was
forfeited to his Majesty in consequence of not having been used
for the purposes of the said Canal; which forfeiture, however,
his Majesty was graciously pleased to remit: and by the third
section of this Act, the said field is &ldquo;discharged of all
forfeiture to his said Majesty, his heirs and successors, under
any Statutes of Mortmain.&rdquo;&nbsp; These Statutes are also
dispensed with by the tenth clause for other lands conveyed; and
the Company indemnify the bishop and his lessees from the
rent-charge of &pound;349 15<i>s.</i>, payable to the aforesaid
James Crompton, his heirs and assigns.&nbsp; The twentieth
section confirms the leases already granted to this Company; and
the twenty-first, enacts that all future leases shall be
conformable to the one already granted.&nbsp; A plan, but on a
smaller scale, similar to the one attached to the preceding Act,
is also appended to this.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>But the
great Act relative to the Paddington estate&mdash;that which was
intended to give an epitome of preceding Acts, to bind and cement
the whole, and put the key-stone into this expansive legislative
arch&mdash;is the forty-fifth chapter in the sixth year of the
reign of George the fourth, anno 1825, entitled&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An Act to enlarge the powers of several
Acts passed in thirty-fifth, forty-fourth, forty-fifth, and
forty-eighth years of the reign of his Majesty King George the
third, for enabling the Lord Bishop of London to grant a lease,
with powers of renewal, of lands in the parish of Paddington, in
the county of Middlesex, for the purpose of building upon, and to
appoint new trustees, and for other purposes relating
thereto.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1824, the rate-payers of Paddington were seduced, in a
manner hereafter to be mentioned, to resign into the hands of the
wealthy proprietors, and a certain number of vestry-men, elected
under the detestable principles of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act,
those inherent rights which their predecessors had protected,
with more or less determination, for centuries; and the next year
saw the official representatives of this select body, and the
curate of the parish, joining the Bishop of London and his
lessees, in beseeching his Majesty that the several objects
contained in the aforesaid Act, might be accomplished.&nbsp; One
object was, to increase the quantity of land to four hundred
acres, for which building leases might be granted; and another,
to exclude the &ldquo;Curates of Paddington, the said
Churchwardens and their successors&rdquo; from &ldquo;all
estates, right, title, interest, benefit, claim, or demand
whatsoever of, into, out of and upon the lands and hereditaments
comprised in or which are or may be subjected to&rdquo;
&ldquo;the lease granted by Bishop Porteus, in 1795; excepting in
so far as is expressed in this Act.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in
consideration of this wholesale surrender of all the interest,
benefit, &amp;c. which the inhabitants of Paddington ought at
this time to receive out of the Rectory and other lands, William
(Howley) Bishop of London, and his lessees were graciously
pleased to consent, that it may be enacted, &ldquo;that the
Curate&rsquo;s former stipend of &pound;120 a-year shall be
increased to &pound;200 per annum;&rdquo; that ground may be
granted for the site of the said Curate&rsquo;s residence,
&ldquo;not exceeding one acre;&rdquo; and &ldquo;that any
quantity of the said estate not exceeding four acres may be
conveyed by deed to trustees or commissioners, appointed under
Church Building Acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having already analysed preceding Acts, it only remains for <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>me to notice
here, that this ponderous piece of private legislation, which
occupies no less than seventy-three pages of the statute book, is
chiefly a resume of that which had been before enacted.&nbsp; It
provides, however, as we have seen, for double the number of
houses, and therefore for a vast increase in the revenues of this
estate; it provides for the increase of a curate&rsquo;s stipend,
by eighty pounds per annum; and it grants sites for
churches&mdash;&ldquo;if at any time hereafter it should on
account of the increase of the population, or on any other
account, be found necessary or convenient to erect and build the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also provides for the appointment of new
trustees both at the present, and any future period; for altering
the conditions in the covenants in under-leases; and for raising
an additional twenty thousand pounds by mortgage.</p>
<p>It further informs us that the previous mortgage of ten
thousand pounds was settled on Dame Morshead; and it enacts that
the former sum, as well as this, shall be paid off by fines on
the renewal of the present building leases; the Bishop of London
for the time being, to be answerable for one-third of the
interest on these sums, and the trustees for the other
two-thirds.&nbsp; The sum permitted to be borrowed by this Act is
to be used in improving the estate, as well as all monies
received for the sale of gravel, &amp;c., and any sum that may
arise from selling or letting the waters, springs, &amp;c,
purchased of the corporation of London; which by this Act the
Bishop and his lessees are empowered to let or sell for that
purpose.</p>
<p>There are two schedules annexed to this Act, both bearing the
signature, J. H. Budd.&nbsp; The first is a description of the
several pieces and parcels of land composing &ldquo;the
Paddington Estate,&rdquo; amounting in the whole, it is here
stated, to six hundred and eleven acres and a half.&nbsp; The
second contains an account of sums received and paid on account
of the same property.&nbsp; By this account we learn that twelve
acres, three roods, and fifteen perches and a half of land
belonging to this estate had been sold under the Land-tax
Redemption Act, and the 52nd George III; for which, it is stated,
&pound;6573 0s. 11d. was received.&nbsp; &pound;2000 was also
received for two acres, three roods, and twenty-eight perches,
&ldquo;used by the Regent&rsquo;s Canal Company.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&pound;10,256 12s. 3d. &ldquo;by sale of brick earth, gravel and
sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &pound;1140 18s. 2d. by sale of old
materials, water pipes, &amp;c.&nbsp; Making with the
&pound;10,000 borrowed, a sum of &pound;29,970 11s. 4d.&nbsp; The
payments being &pound;27,857 6s. 2d. including the small item of
&pound;4,530 17s. 11d. for law expences.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>In
these Acts and Deeds will be found the true history of &ldquo;the
Paddington Estate;&rdquo; the few finishing touches which have
been given to it, during the possession of the See of London by
the present Bishop, being comparatively unimportant.&nbsp; But
Dr. Blomfield has derived more personal benefit from the policy
of his predecessors than those who assisted in establishing it
could have contemplated would ever fall to the lot of any one
bishop.&nbsp; What have been the actual receipts from this estate
for the last twenty years, few men can tell; but if we were to
calculate the average for that period at &pound;5,000 per annum,
I think we should not over-rate the bishop&rsquo;s receipts from
this &ldquo;little farm;&rdquo; and one hundred thousand pounds
in twenty years from one estate is not so bad.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Great Western Railway Bills there
has been, so far as I know, only one Act of Parliament passed
since the great Act of 1825, having especial reference to the
Paddington estate.&nbsp; This was &ldquo;an Act for confirming
and carrying into execution certain articles of agreement made
and entered into between Charles James, Lord Bishop of London,
the Trustees of the Paddington estate, the Grand Junction Canal,
and the Grand Junction Water Works Companies, and for other
purposes therein mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this Act we learn that the Grand Junction Water Works
Company, having erected other works and reservoirs near Kew
Bridge and at Camden Hill, were desirous of using their land in
Paddington for building-ground, as it had become much more
valuable for that purpose than for the purposes for which it was
originally leased.&nbsp; To enable them to do this the Company
had to apply to the Bishop of London, and the trustees for their
consent; and this consent was granted, upon condition &ldquo;that
the said sites, as well the freehold as the leasehold parts
thereof, shall be laid out and built on by such class and
description of buildings as approved by the surveyor of the
Paddington estate.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And also upon condition
that the said Company shall give up and relinquish, for the site
of an intended hospital,&rdquo; a plot of ground two hundred feet
from north to south, and one hundred and eighty feet from east to
west; and also give up and relinquish another plot, seventy feet
by one hundred feet, &ldquo;for the site of an intended new
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this Act the Grand Junction Canal Company are for ever
released and discharged from all covenants, agreements, and
undertakings, relating to the powers and privileges of supplying
with water the inhabitants of this parish; and the <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Grand
Junction Water Works Company take upon themselves their
liabilities in this respect: the bishop, and trustees, agreeing
to lease the land, already occupied by this Company, with the
exception of the plots mentioned, &ldquo;at the yearly rent of a
peppercorn.&rdquo;&nbsp; The expences of this Act were to be
wholly borne by the Company, and the Company are bound by it to
provide the inhabitants of Paddington, and parishes and streets
adjacent, with water as heretofore.&nbsp; The tenants of the
Paddington estate, &ldquo;including the inhabitants of the houses
proposed to be built on the sites of the said present reservoirs
and other works of the said Company,&rdquo; to be supplied with
water at the reduced rate of ten pounds per cent., as provided
for by previous Acts.</p>
<p>We have already seen how preceding Acts direct that &ldquo;no
fine, premium, or foregift, or any thing in the nature of a
fine&rdquo; should be taken on letting any portion of the land
which Parliament permitted to be let for building; excepting at
the end of the terms for which the first leases were granted; but
this arrangement extended only to four hundred acres, and as the
situation of these acres was nowhere defined in these Acts, the
Great Western Railway Company, when they wanted thirty-nine acres
of land belonging to this estate for the completion of their line
and terminus, obtained the same at a rent of sixty pounds,
thirteen shillings, and seven-pence three-farthings per annum,
per acre, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> upon paying the present bishop and the
lessees of the estate &pound;30,000.</p>
<p>Since this bargain was struck the bishop and his lessees have
sold other parcels, though at a less famous figure.</p>
<p>On the nineteenth of February, 1841, a special meeting of the
Vestry of Paddington was called to receive and take into
consideration a communication from the Lord Bishop of London,
respecting a piece of ground west of the church-yard.&nbsp; It
was feared this breathing spot was about to be purchased by the
insatiable builders.&nbsp; So, besides the &ldquo;cordial thanks
of the vestry for his kind and timely communication,&rdquo; an
offer of &pound;3500 was made to the bishop and his lessees for
this little lot.&nbsp; Four thousand pounds, however, was the
lowest sum they would take for this portion of the old green; and
the vestry were obliged to be content with the southern portion;
for which the parish paid &pound;2000.&nbsp; The northern portion
was sold to one of the much-dreaded builders; and is now covered
with houses; while on that portion purchased by the parish <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the new
Vestry-hall is being built; to lay, if possible, the ghosts which
are said to have haunted it.</p>
<p>On the first of April, 1845, the Vestry received a letter from
Messrs. Budd and Hayes, stating that the portion of &ldquo;The
Upper Readings,&rdquo; found by the recent admeasurement of Mr.
Gutch to be 5a. 2r. 27p., may be secured by the Vestry for the
purposes of building a workhouse thereon; &ldquo;provided that
the powers of the local Act are sufficient to enable his lordship
and the trustees to effect such sale;&rdquo; and that
&pound;5,700 be given for the same.</p>
<p>Another portion of &ldquo;The Upper Readings&rdquo; was sold
to the trustees of the Lock Hospital.&nbsp; Subsequently to these
purchases, some mutual exchanges took place, which have reduced
the workhouse plot to 5&frac14; acres, and the cost of the land
to &pound;5,168 15<i>s.</i></p>
<p>Other facts relative to this estate, will be found in the next
part of this Work, and after perusing them, in conjunction with
those I have collected in this, I think my readers will conclude,
with me, that the inhabitants of Paddington&mdash;who have to pay
the owners of the Paddington Estate most exorbitant prices for
the privilege of living on their land&mdash;owe but little
gratitude to these lords of the soil for the small favours they
have given, in return for the enormous wealth the industry of
others is placing in their hands.</p>

THE PARISH AND THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<h3><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">DEFINITION&mdash;SITUATION&mdash;BOUNDARIES AND
EXTENT&mdash;GENERAL AND MEDICAL TOPOGRAPHY&mdash;ETYMOLOGY OF
NAMES&mdash;ORIGIN.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blackstone</span> defines a parish to be
&ldquo;that circuit of ground which is committed to the charge of
one parson, or vicar, or other minister having cure of souls
therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; In ordinary language a parish is
&ldquo;that place, or district, which manages its local affairs,
and maintains its own poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newcourt says, &ldquo;This parish of Paddington (which is a
very small one) is within the liberties of Finsbury and
Wenlakesbarn, and lies about three or four miles north-westward
from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lysons tells us, that &ldquo;The Village of Paddington is
situated in the hundred of Ossulston, scarcely a mile north of
Tyburn turnpike, upon the Harrow-road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the other descriptions of the situation of the
&ldquo;pretty little rural village of Paddington,&rdquo; which I
have seen, resemble these given by Newcourt and Lysons; but these
are now so inapplicable to its present state, that it would be
useless to quote from other authorities.</p>
<p>The hundred of Ossulston originally comprised, as I have
already observed, nearly, if not quite, half the county of
Middlesex; but after a time &ldquo;the liberties of
Westminster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the liberties of London,&rdquo;
were taken out of this hundred: that is to say, these places
became of so much importance as to claim and obtain separate
jurisdictions.&nbsp; The hundred of Ossulston was then reduced to
a small portion of the county north and east of London, while by
far the greater part of the old hundred, still waste and wood,
was included under a separate jurisdiction, called in the old
maps &ldquo;Fynnesberry <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and Wen Lax Barne.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another re-arrangement however has taken place; the ancient
liberties of Finsbury and Wenlakesbarn are now included in the
hundred of Ossulston; the hundred itself is separated into four
divisions, and Paddington is included, with certain other
districts, in &ldquo;the Holbourn division&rdquo; of this
re-arranged hundred.</p>
<p>It has been shown, too, in the previous part of this Work,
that the district, first known by the name of Paddington, was,
very probably, confined within the comparatively small space
bounded by the two Roman roads and the bourn; and that,
antecedently to the establishment of this separate district, it
formed a portion of the Tybourn manor.&nbsp; It is also very
probable that Paddington was included in the Parish of Tybourn,
before the monks of Westminster established their claim to it,
and annexed it to St. Margaret&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At a later period,
when Paddington became a separate parish, the whole of that
district which is now known as Westbourn; the manor of Notting
Barns; and all that Chelsea now claims north of the Great Western
Road; as well as the manor of Paddington, and a considerable
portion of that which now belongs to Marylebone, were included in
it.</p>
<p>The post-office authorities, even to this day, include a
considerable portion of Marylebone in their map of Paddington;
and if we take the &ldquo;Via Originaria&rdquo; of the Romans,
&ldquo;The Watling Street&rdquo; of former days, to have been the
eastern boundary of this parish at all periods, still even that
would give to Paddington a long strip of the south-west corner of
the present parish of Marylebone; for I think those who will
examine this subject, will come to the conclusion, that the old
Roman road was that road which is seen in Rocque&rsquo;s maps,
continuing in a straight line from Tybourn-lane along the high
ground to the top of Maida-hill.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s Chronicle of the Kings of
England,&rdquo; p. 313, we find a record of many works of public
utility, performed, in the reign of Edward the sixth, by the
Rowland Hill of that day.&nbsp; And in the third year of that
king&rsquo;s reign, when Sir Rowland was Lord Mayor of London, we
find it chronicled &ldquo;that he likewise made the highway to
Kilburne near to London;&rdquo; previously to which time, I
presume, the old military way was the only road in use.</p>
<p>In Rocque&rsquo;s maps we see three roads branching off in a
northerly direction from the Tybourn-road (now Oxford-street);
one, opposite North Audley-street, another, opposite Tybourn-lane
(now Park-lane), and the third, the present Edgeware-road.&nbsp;
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>I
believe it was the road nearest the city which was made by Sir
Rowland Hill; the central one, as above indicated, being the
ancient Roman road; and the present road being the most modern;
but both &ldquo;Watling-street&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Watery-lane&rdquo; are now obliterated from the map; and
the land occupied by these roads, with the triangular or
gore-shaped piece which lay to the west, between the ancient road
and the present Edgeware-road, now forms a portion of the
adjoining parish.</p>
<p>It was on this piece of land, the highest point of ground on
this part of the Tybourn-road, that the gallows was erected when
it was removed from &ldquo;The Elmes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the Great Western-road took a more southerly course
previously to &ldquo;the Hyde Farm&rdquo; having been converted
into Hyde, or &ldquo;High,&rdquo; Park, by Henry the eighth, I do
not know; but from the facts already advanced, it appears certain
that this triangular-shaped parish was at one time a much larger
triangle than it now is; the base of which, in all probability,
extended from Shepherd&rsquo;s Rush to Kilbourn Bridge.</p>
<p>At the present time the eastern boundary of Paddington parish
is formed by the Edgeware-road from where Tybourn-gate stood in
1829, <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> to where Kilbourn-gate now stands;
the southern boundary being marked out by the Uxbridge-road from
its junction with the Edgeware-road to the head of the
Serpentine, with the exception of that piece of Tybourn-field
which was sold for a burying-ground to St. George&rsquo;s, and
which now, with St. George&rsquo;s-terrace, forms a portion of
that parish.&nbsp; Paddington claims a considerable strip of
Kensington-gardens, and is bounded west and north-west by an
imaginary and irregular line, known only to the authorities and a
few parish boys, which runs over and through houses, greenhouses,
&amp;c., from the centre of the road opposite Palace-gardens, to
Kilbourn-gate.&nbsp; Or, to use the official words of the
district surveyor, &ldquo;Paddington is bounded on the north by
the parish of Willesden; on the south by the parish of St.
Margaret, Westminster, and St. George, Hanover-square; on the
east by the parish of St. Mary-le-bone; and on the west by the
parishes of St. Mary Abbots, Kensington, and a detached part of
St. Luke, Chelsea.&rdquo; <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a></p>
<p>In the population-returns for 1831, this area was said to
contain <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>1,220 acres of land.&nbsp; Whether this return was made
for the sake of giving round numbers, or whether the parish has
extended during this century, I cannot say; but Lysons says that
&ldquo;Paddington contains, according to an actual survey in the
possession of William Strong, esq. (a former bishop&rsquo;s
agent), 1197a. 3r. 30p.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Registrar-General&rsquo;s Report on Cholera in England,
1848&ndash;49,&rdquo; I find the &ldquo;area in acres&rdquo; of
Paddington put down at 1277.&nbsp; This estimate was given to the
Registrar-General by Captain Dawson, R.E. of the Tithe
Commission. <a name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a></p>
<p>Lysons tells us, &ldquo;the soil in the neighbourhood of the
village is principally factitious, having been much enriched by
great quantities of manure.&nbsp; On the east of a little brook
which runs by Kilbourn and Bayswater, the soil is a thin clay
upon a dry bed of gravel; on the west side of this brook a deep
clay, the springs lying very far beneath the
surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; In proof of which he states that a well
sunk by Mr. Coulson, of Westbourn house, had to be dug 300 feet
deep before water was found; the earth of the first 100 feet, he
tells us, was a bluish clay, &ldquo;then, a thin stratum of
stone, then, another bed of clay.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another well,
dug in the same neighbourhood, water was found at the depth of
250 feet.</p>
<p>These statements respecting the water must be taken to refer
to the valley through which the Westbourn ran; for on the eastern
side of the brook, south of Maida-hill, and on the eastern side
of Craven-hill which lies to the west of the stream, many wells
existed which were not more than ten or fifteen feet deep. <a
name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a>&nbsp; Indeed, Lysons tells us, that
&ldquo;the springs at Bayswater lie near the surface, and that
the water is very fine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, the people of
Paddington seem to have had no lack of water, nor any reason to
complain either of the quality or cost of this essential element
of life.</p>
<p>Previously to the present century, the most desirable spots in
the district had been selected for the dwellings of the
inhabitants; and when the bishop&rsquo;s first building Act was
granted only 200 acres were allowed to be built on, because the
other portions of the estate were not considered &ldquo;fit for
building purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the modern builder&rsquo;s
art despises any delicate notions about fitness or unfitness for
the situation of a <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>house.&nbsp; A plot of ground shall be covered; a
street shall be built, says the money-making builder; and, when
the street is finished, who will know whether this or that
particular house is built on gravel, or clay, or mud?&nbsp; Who
will take the trouble to ascertain whether the elevated road to
his entrance-hall, or the spot on which his house is placed, was
made by nature&rsquo;s laws, or by the scavenger&rsquo;s
cart?&nbsp; As to the drainage of the house, and the supply of
water, these are hidden mysteries, with which no dweller in a
house, except a master-builder, is expected to trouble
himself.&nbsp; Respecting any of these matters, the owner of the
soil will be rarely found to interfere, excepting it is to take
part with the builder; for the value of his land has been
enormously increased by that industrious speculator.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, those who live in houses, are beginning
to find out that not only the healthfulness of their own
dwelling, but that of their neighbours also, very much concerns
them.&nbsp; Fortunately, too, especially for the dwellers in
large towns, men who have made hygeic science a study cannot be
sneered down, or &ldquo;put down&rdquo; by &ldquo;practical
builders.&rdquo;&nbsp; But until <i>the people</i> thoroughly
understand the nature of those requirements which constitute
healthful dwellings; and until they are determined to press upon
the legislature the enactment of those laws which are necessary
to constitute them such, and to restrain, by more stringent laws,
the lust after mammon of &ldquo;the speculative builder,&rdquo;
both their health and life will remain in very unsafe
keeping.</p>
<p>The builder may say that the legislature of a country has no
right to interfere in an affair of so private a nature as the
building of a house; that every man is able to judge for himself
in what house he will live; and that it is his own fault if he
take a bad one.&nbsp; So long as houses were built to last
<i>more</i> than ninety-nine years, and were nearly a mile apart,
all this may have been true, but experience has taught us that
this does not hold good when applied to towns; it has taught us
that cities would be in a much worse state than they now are but
for those inefficient laws which exist at the present time; and
it has taught us that to choose an abode in ignorance of almost
all the necessary requirements which constitute a healthful
dwelling is a species of ignorance by no means of the blissful
family.&nbsp; To distinguish good from evil in every object which
surrounds us is one of the necessities of our nature; to have
&ldquo;a foe under foot,&rdquo; <a name="citation105"></a><a
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a> a foe overhead,
and a foe on every side, <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>without a determination to subdue
this legion, does not say much for the wisdom either of the
governors, or the governed; and to care nothing about the
expenditure of millions collected annually for local purposes, is
no proof of confidence in the governors, is no proof of the
happiness or wisdom of the governed; it may however prove, that
the people are &ldquo;silly sheep&rdquo; <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a> who may be shorn by any tool, at the
bidding of any despot.</p>
<p>Experience has proved that no more healthful situation for a
town can be chosen, than elevated ground above the banks of a
pure stream; and those who fixed on the south portion of the
Westbourn district, and on the site of the old village of
Paddington, as spots for their dwellings, could not have been
ignorant either of the material advantages such situations
afforded, or of the effects produced both on the mind and body by
the beauty and salubrity of these localities.</p>
<p>If we spoke of the beauties of Paddington to those whose
acquaintance with this place is of recent date, they would
naturally think we were about to describe the gorgeous mansions
of the fashionable &ldquo;Tyburnia.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the old
village of Tybourn, or Westbourn, and the new town of
P&aelig;dings, were surrounded by a greater combination of
natural beauty than those who have not studied the ancient
topography of this district can well conceive.</p>
<p>Out of thirty-seven districts, into which, for certain special
purposes, the Registrar-General has arranged London and its
vicinity, in a series of excellent tables contained in his very
valuable Report on Cholera, we find that there are only four
parishes of greater average elevation than Paddington; the
estimated elevation of this parish above Trinity high watermark
being seventy-six feet; Pancras eighty; Islington eighty-eight;
Marylebone one hundred; and Hampstead three hundred and
fifty.</p>
<p>On referring to those accurate and beautiful surveys published
by the Ordnance Map-Office, I find that the highest point in
Paddington, the peak of Maida-hill, rises to 120 feet 9 inches,
while the lowest, Elms-lane, sinks to 57 feet.&nbsp; In <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>fact,
Paddington consists chiefly of two hills, Maida-hill and
Craven-hill; the north-eastern slope of Notting-hill; and a
valley, through which the Tybourn ran.&nbsp; In the south part of
the parish this valley is very narrow, but to the north it
spreads out into Maida Vale.</p>
<p>Woodfield road, and the neighbourhood, is another elevated
spot in Paddington, but in the whole of that part of the parish,
as well as in Maida Yale, the clay is immediately below the
surface.&nbsp; In some places the surface has been raised by the
earth dug out of the Canal, and in others, by deposits brought
from other parts of London; indeed the alterations which have
taken place, inconsequence of the removal of the natural soil,
and the addition of &ldquo;made ground,&rdquo; make it difficult
to tell what is the natural elevation of any particular spot in
the parish.</p>
<p>The tables from which I have just now quoted, and other
authenticated statistical accounts, tend to prove that the number
of feet we live above high water-mark is an appreciable quantity
in the account of health and disease, life and death.&nbsp; But
elevation is only one item, though an important one, in this
important account.&nbsp; The <i>nature</i> as well as the
<i>height</i> of the soil on which we live, influences the health
and life of every living being.</p>
<p>A considerable portion of the ground, composing the south and
south-eastern parts of Paddington, consists of sand and gravel;
the northern and north-western parts being clay.&nbsp; Vast
quantities of the former have been removed; and although the
Paddington soil was sufficiently &ldquo;factitious&rdquo; at the
time Lysons wrote, it has become much more so since that
time.&nbsp; Those only who have carefully watched the modes which
have been adopted to raise the ground for making new roads, and
for elevating the basement of houses in certain parts of this
parish, can form any idea of the immense quantity of
&ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; which has been &ldquo;shot
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to the nature of a great deal of that
rubbish, I will not offend my readers by attempting any
description.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that thousands of loads of
sand and gravel have been taken away since the Act passed which
permitted the sale of this natural soil, and vegetable and animal
matters of all kinds, and in all stages of putrefaction, have
been emptied into hollow places.&nbsp; Besides the effect
produced by the poisonous gases which must arise from such
factitious soil, other bad effects frequently follow the removal
of the natural earth and the substitution of made ground.&nbsp;
All the house-drains which are laid on the latter, sink, and in a
short time become either partially, or wholly, useless for the
purpose for <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>which they were made; and new drains, constructed at
great expence and inconvenience, are necessary.&nbsp; When from
this or any other cause, the drain does not empty itself into the
common sewer, it is emphatically termed by the men who work in
the sewers, &ldquo;a dead&rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having for several years lived in a house which owned one of
these dead drains, and having been very nearly &ldquo;a
dead&rsquo;un&rdquo; myself in consequence, I was led to enquire
into this subject somewhat minutely; and although the drainage of
an immense city is too important a subject to be treated of by
the topographer in a sketch of a single parish, yet I cannot
refrain from saying a word or two in this place on a point of
such vital consequence.</p>
<p>The Thames having been most mischievously used as the great
common sewer for London and its neighbourhood; and Paddington
which is so much above its level, having been drained into it,
one would have imagined that the system of drainage here would
have completely removed all debris from so elevated a spot.&nbsp;
Such, however, has not been the case, as I have learned from the
Reports of the Sewer Commissioners, and from a personal
inspection of some of the sewers.</p>
<p>Nothing worthy the name of a system of drainage, can be
secured, till the great river, which was intended by its Creator
to bring health and life to the people, instead of being made by
man the instrument of his own disease and death, is freed from
the sewerage of a whole metropolis: yet much good may be done in
the mean time, and at a comparatively small outlay.</p>
<p>Thousands of drains, now existing, have been made of such
porous bricks, and these have been placed side by side with such
an unadhesive layer of dirt, that instead of acting as an
impervious tube through which the soil could pass to its
destination, the common sewer, the bottom of the drain acts as a
mere filter for its contents.&nbsp; Glazed earthenware
pipe-drains have been introduced to obviate this and other great
evils; and the dwellers in towns have seldom had a greater
blessing befall them, than this discovery.&nbsp; These tubular
drains are cemented together, so as to form a hollow tube, and
are laid at so much per foot under the regulation of the Sewers
Office, by workmen who understand what a <i>house-drain</i>
should be; and it must be understood that a <i>house</i>-drain
and a <i>field</i>-drain are two distinct things; though very
many builders have thought what would do for one, would do for
the other.</p>
<p>Why there is not a good system of main drainage for London;
why the Thames is still made the generator of disease and <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>death, I do
not know, except it be to shew the inefficiency of our governors;
but if the New Sewers Commission had done no other good, it
deserves praise for the facilities it has given for the use of
this more perfect system of house-drainage; and after all it is
of more consequence that the drain to the sewer should be
perfect, than that the sewer itself should be so, although the
latter is undoubtedly essential.</p>
<p>All those who wish to live in a healthful house, will adopt
this tubular system of house-drainage; but those who cannot or
will not have a perfect drain, may adopt a small part of the
modern tubular system with great advantage and at a trifling
cost.&nbsp; At present, the great majority of drains open
directly into the common sewer, and act as chimnies for the
conveyance of poisonous gases into the interior of the houses,
the water-traps only partially preventing this evil.&nbsp; Others
enter the sewer so low, that when they are not performing this
office, they frequently form a portion of the common sewer
itself, and are invariably filled with its contents, when
&ldquo;flushing&rdquo; is performed.</p>
<p>A simple lid of glazed earth, hanging from the upper part of
the mouth of the drain, provides against these evils to a very
great extent; and this precaution should always be used, till a
more effectual substitute is found.</p>
<p>Some portions of Paddington which have been built on, are
amongst the most desirable spots, as places of residence, to be
found in the immediate vicinity of London; and these would be
rendered unexceptionable by a perfect system of water supply and
drainage.&nbsp; But, as yet that good time has not come even for
the most healthful and most fashionable houses in Tyburnia.</p>
<p>So much has been said and written on the subject of burying
the dead in the midst of the living, that it would appear useless
to add another word on this subject; and at length some of the
effects produced on living bodies by the poisonous gases which
arise from church-yards are well known.</p>
<p>We have already seen that Paddington is blessed with two
burying grounds, one of which was established for the benefit of
the rector of St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover-square, and his rich
parishioners; and although this burial-ground was at one time
extra-mural, the inhabitants of Albion-street, Upper
Berkeley-street, Connaught-square, and St. George&rsquo;s-row,
have found out that it is no longer so.&nbsp; For some of the
particular evils attendant on having this large burial-ground
surrounded by houses, I must refer my readers to &ldquo;<i>An
account of the measures </i><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span><i>adopted by the Medical
Practitioners residing in the Western District of Paddington</i>,
<i>to obtain the</i> <span class="smcap">Closure</span> <i>of
the</i> <span class="smcap">Burial-Ground</span> <i>situated in
the</i> <span class="smcap">Uxbridge Road</span>,&rdquo; and to a
Return on the Metropolitan Burials, Act, just printed by order of
the House of Commons.&nbsp; For an exposition of the general
evils of intra-mural interment, and an account of some of the
disgraceful practices connected with it, I cannot do better than
refer to &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gatherings</span> from <span
class="smcap">Grave Yards</span>,&rdquo; and Mr. Walker&rsquo;s
other works on these subjects.</p>
<p>To secure a healthful dwelling, then, it is necessary to know
something of the elevation and the nature of the soil; the
quality of the water; the efficiency of the drainage; the size of
the house relative to the number of its intended inhabitants; and
indeed, all those considerations which influence the quality of
the air we breathe, should be taken into account.&nbsp; But it is
not my intention to enter into an examination of all the items
which compose a healthful dwelling; much less to count up those
points which give an ideal value to a house on a
&ldquo;Bishop&rsquo;s Estate,&rdquo; though, judging from the
puffing advertisements, which for years crowded the advertising
columns of the <i>Times</i>, there must have been great and
healing virtues in these magic words.&nbsp; In those
advertisements, however, we saw no account of the contracted
area; the deep narrow back yard; the thin and crumbling walls;
the gaping doors and windows; the damp and ill ventilated
basement; the absence of drainage; the want of bath-rooms,
&amp;c. &amp;c.;&mdash;all such things had to be found out by the
in-coming tenant, and remedied at his cost.&nbsp; But for the
want of these essentials, the &ldquo;pretty paper,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;handsome cornice,&rdquo; made but poor compensation, even
in houses advertised for sale at a few thousand pounds,
&ldquo;with a trifling ground-rent of seventy-five pounds per
annum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many suggestions have been offered relative to the derivation
of the word <i>Paddington</i>; but that suggested by Mr.
Kemble&mdash;one of the greatest living authorities on
antiquarian topography&mdash;seems to me to be the most deserving
consideration.&nbsp; Mr. Kemble observes, in his preface to the
third volume of the Codex Diplomaticus, that the Anglo-Saxon,
like most German names of places, are nearly always composite
words; that is, they consist of two or more parts; the second
generally of wide and common signification; the first a kind of
definition limiting this general name to one particular
application.</p>
<p>The former portion of these compound names, he says, may be
classed under various heads, as the names of animals, birds, <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>trees,
fishes, &amp;c.; others refer to mythological or divine
personages; and others contain the names of individuals and
families.&nbsp; To this latter division he refers Paddington in
the first volume of his &ldquo;Saxons in England;&rdquo; where he
has inferred a mark&mdash;&ldquo;P&aelig;dingas&rdquo;&mdash;for
the name of this place&mdash;Tun, the enclosure or town,
P&aelig;dingas of the P&aelig;dings.&nbsp; It is true, this is
one of three names, of which Mr. Kemble appears to entertain some
doubt; but all other explanations I have met with appear to me
open to more serious objections.&nbsp; Dr. R. G. Latham, the
father of the modern school of English philology, tells us that
&ldquo;in the Greek language the notion of lineal descent, in
other words, the relation of the son to the father, is expressed
by a particular termination;&rdquo; and that this Greek mode of
expression is very different from the English termination,
<i>son</i>, and the Gaelic prefix, <i>mac</i>; which in fact make
the words to which they are joined only compound words.&nbsp; But
he asks is there anything in English corresponding to the Greek
patronymics, and answers, &ldquo;In Anglo-Saxon the termination
<i>ing</i> is as truly patronymic as <span
class="GutSmall">IDES</span> is in Greek. * * * In the
Bible-translation the son of Elisha is called Elising.&nbsp; In
the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occur such genealogies as the
following:&mdash;Ida was Eopping, Eoppa Esing, &amp;c.&mdash;Ida
was the son of Eoppa, Eoppa of Esing, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
learned Doctor further informs us that &ldquo;In the plural
number these forms denote the <i>race of</i>&mdash;as
Scyldingas&mdash;to the Scyldings, or the race of Scyld,&rdquo;
<a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> or P&oelig;dingas&mdash;to the
P&aelig;dings, or the race of P&aelig;d.</p>
<p>With other names in Paddington there is not much
difficulty.</p>
<p>The burne, bourn, or brook, which ran through Paddington gave
its name to a district.&nbsp; Tybourn I believe to have been the
original name; but the houses erected on the west side of this
stream, with the district surrounding them, were eventually
called by the name of Westbourn; the name which was given to the
stream.&nbsp; Respecting the origin of the word Bayswater&mdash;a
name given to a portion of the Westbourn district&mdash;many
suggestions have been offered; but the first of the three given
by Mr. Osborne in his letter to Mr. Urban, in the
Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, dated March 25th, 1798, appears to me
to be the correct one.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;Perhaps the name of
Bays is derived from the original owner of the land;&rdquo; and
from the Inquisitions taken in the early part of the fourteenth
century, to be found in the first part of this Work, it will be
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>perceived that there was then a Juliana Baysbolle
holding land in Westbourn.&nbsp; At the end of the fourteenth
century, we find from Tanner&rsquo;s note, before quoted, that
the head of water given by the Abbot was called Bayard&rsquo;s
Watering Place; and although this may have been the name used in
legal documents for the district surrounding it, yet Bays
Watering has been the name used by the people.&nbsp; There may,
indeed, have been two watering places for the weary traveller;
and mine host Bays, and mine host Bayard, may have been rivals
for public favour; the one living on one side of the King&rsquo;s
highway, and the other on the opposite.</p>
<p>Knotting, or Notting, seems to have been but a corruption of
Nutting; the wood on and around the hill of that name, having for
centuries being appropriately so called.</p>
<p>Kensell, or Kensale, comes, as I take it, from
King&rsquo;s-field.&nbsp; In the Harleian MS. (printed at page
38,) the green of this name is called Kellsell, and
Kingefelde.&nbsp; In Mary&rsquo;s reign, we perceive by this
document, also, that &ldquo;the Green-lane&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kingsefelde-green&rdquo; were the same place.&nbsp; And as
&ldquo;the Green-lanes&rdquo; now exist&mdash;in name&mdash;we
may ascertain with something like accuracy the situation of this
field, or green, which formerly belonged to the King.</p>
<p>The names of Squares, Terraces, Streets, &amp;c., have been
for the most part furnished by the names of the owners of
property, past or present, their native counties, or country
residences.</p>
<p>Spring-street, Brook-street, Conduit-street, Market-street,
&amp;c., point out the situations of objects formerly on, or
near, those sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tichborne-street,&rdquo; although not built in the time
of Henry the eighth, reminds us of one &ldquo;Nicholas Tychborne,
gent., husband of the second daughter and co-heir of Alderman
Fenroper;&rdquo; of Alderman Tichbourn, one of Cromwell&rsquo;s
peers and King Charles&rsquo;s judges; and of a dirty ditch which
ran down the side of the Edgeware-road from Maida-hill; and
Maida-hill, itself, reminds us of the famous battle of
Maida.&nbsp; Praed-street preserves the memory of the banker of
that name; one of the first Directors of the Grand Junction Canal
Company; and of the lands they secured, as well for the purposes
for which they professedly obtained them, as for the purposes to
which they have been applied.</p>
<p>The name of Frederick, once well known here, became so
distasteful to the people of Paddington, that it is preserved
only in a mews; while the memory of the capacious generosity of
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the Lady
Margaret, Countess of Richmond, to the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, will be long preserved in Paddington by the Squares
and Terraces of those names.&nbsp; There is now a Shelden-street,
to remind us of a bishop&rsquo;s gift to his nephews; and a
Porteus Road and Terrace, that we may not forget the good and
generous Beilby who gave away, or sold, two-thirds of the
proceeds of the Paddington estate.&nbsp; Pickering-place and
Terrace preserve the memory of a former curate, and of a friendly
Chancery suit relating to the property here; and while all sorts
of changes are rung on the names of the living, it has been
thought expedient to place Blomfield and Cromwell Terraces in a
continuous line in the highway to a Public School.</p>
<p>The civil division of the land, recognised by the
Anglo-Saxons, were the Mark, or March; the G&acirc;, or Shire;
and the Hid, or Hide.&nbsp; To understand these divisions, as Mr.
Kemble has described them, is to comprehend the natural origin of
every inhabited place in this country; and the origin of all our
constitutional law.</p>
<p>The Mark he describes to be the smallest and simplest division
of the land which was held by many men in common, or by several
households under settled conditions, the next in order to the
private estates, the hids or alods of the markmen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As its name denotes, it is something marked out or
defined, having settled boundaries; something serving as a sign
to others, and distinguished by signs.&nbsp; It is the plot of
land on which a greater or lesser number of free men have settled
for the purposes of cultivation, and for the sake of mutual
profit and protection; and it comprises a portion both of arable

class="citation">[113]</a>&nbsp; Other meanings were attached, to
this word, Mark, which are thoroughly examined by this learned
historian, and to his works I must refer those of my readers who
wish to obtain a complete insight into the ancient divisions of
the land, and the manners and customs of our Saxon ancestors.</p>
<p>The G&acirc; or Shire was but a number of these marks united
under one general government.</p>
<p>The Hid or Hide was &ldquo;the estate of one household, the
amount of land sufficient for the support of one
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a series of learned calculations and
investigations Mr. Kemble has proved that the hide was a stated
quantity of <i>arable</i> land, not much over thirty Saxon acres,
equal to forty Norman acres; he shews that the Saxons had a large
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>and a
small acre, and explains, by this fact, how the hide came to have
been considered one hundred and twenty acres.&nbsp; He shews that
the forest, meadow, and pasture-land was common property; and
that it was attached to the hyde as of common-right.&nbsp; But,
for a complete exposition of this subject, I must also refer my
readers to the fourth chapter of the first book of Mr.
Kemble&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The fact of Paddington in Surrey, or &ldquo;Padendene&rdquo;
as it was called, being mentioned in the Conqueror&rsquo;s
survey, <a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> while Paddington in Middlesex was not
noticed, inclines me to believe the <i>dene</i>, or <i>den</i>,
in Surrey, was the original mark of the P&aelig;dings; and that
the smaller enclosure in Middlesex was at first peopled and
cultivated by a migration of a portion of that family from the
<i>den</i> when it had become inconveniently full.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say the Surrey valley was too crowded when
this migration took place; but the lord, or his man, one or both
might have pressed a little too hard on some of the young cubs in
the Surrey den; and as they had no Press through which to make
their wrongs known, they may have thought it best to move off
before any other wrongs were inflicted.</p>
<p>At what period this migration happened, it is impossible to
say; but there is very little doubt that the first settlement was
made near the bourn, or brook, which ran through the
forest.&nbsp; And this brook, though now a deep under-ground
sewer <a name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a> which has been made, by the aid of
the mason, to give a few more ground-rents to the bishop and his
lessees, while it carries its hidden pollution to the capacious
bosom of &ldquo;Father Thames,&rdquo;&mdash;once gave life to a
most beautiful valley, and was itself, at times, no insignificant
stream.&nbsp; At the beginning of this century it was a favourite
resort for the young fishermen; <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and, as depicted in Norden&rsquo;s
Map of Middlesex, <a name="citation115a"></a><a
href="#footnote115a" class="citation">[115a]</a> we see what it
was in the time of Elizabeth, when the waters, taking their
natural courses from the hills of Hampstead and Highgate, found
their way into it.</p>
<p>What amount of disease and death has been caused by the
impurities it has been made to hold since that time is a mystery;
but one into which those have had a peep, who have taken the
trouble to read the disclosures which have been made respecting
the Serpentine, <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a> into which it
was for years made to pour its many abominations.</p>
<p>By the side of a pure and then beautiful stream, at a later
period named the Westbourn, the first &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; was
made; and in all probability on the eminence above this brook,
perhaps on the very spot where the first Christian temple was
raised, the inhabitants of this Mark first offered up their
adoration to that God which their intelligence had taught them to
worship; and let not those who occupy their places in well
cushioned pews near this spot, decry or despise that worship; for
it was the sincere and spontaneous act of the unenlightened mind,
unmixed with the sins of a cold formality, or the hypocrisy of a
political sham.&nbsp; However misguided our ancestors were, they
were sincere, and they wanted not the support of the State to
bolster up their peculiar dogmas, but freely consecrated a
portion of the Mark to the services of religion.&nbsp; And the
present christian Bishop of London, and his lay lessees, may now
have the honour of receiving the proceeds of land once dedicated
to Pagan worship. <a name="citation115c"></a><a
href="#footnote115c" class="citation">[115c]</a></p>
<p>The Mark included a considerable extent of the forest around
the portion cleared; and this portion of the Mark, the forest or
waste-land, was, as we have seen, the common property of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; To protect their rights in this common
property against powerful and ambitious individuals, was for
centuries the constant care of the people, as it was the special
object of many of our ancient laws.&nbsp; How these laws were
evaded; how by force or fraud &ldquo;the lords of the soil&rdquo;
managed to transfer those lands to their own keeping; and how
cunning <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>and designing men have over-reached them in return; so
that, at last, scarcely a scrap of all their former rights remain
to the public, for public uses, I have made some attempt to tell,
so far as the Paddington Mark is concerned.&nbsp; But a complete
history of these transactions remains to be written.</p>
<p>The formation of the Mark, and the reception of its occupants
into the family of the state, were not the work of a day: and
these long preceded the parochial arrangement; which latter,
indeed, was an ecclesiastical division of the land, said to have
been introduced into England in the seventh century by Honorius,
Archbishop of Canterbury: but this is evidently one of those
errors so common in history, where one man is often credited or
debited with deeds which belong to, and should be fairly divided
among many individuals.&nbsp; It is this error, as Mr. Kemble has
most strikingly pointed out, which has frequently made a saint,
or a devil, when no heroic quality belonged to the person so set
on high for admiration or detestation.</p>
<p>Modern research has made it pretty certain that the ancient
parishes, &ldquo;parochi&aelig;,&rdquo; of England were the
districts adopted by the several teachers of Christianity who
first promulgated the truths of the gospel in this country.&nbsp;
These divisions, made for securing the spread of the &ldquo;Good
News&rdquo; through the whole of the country, must necessarily,
at first, have been very rudely defined&mdash;but then there was
not, at that time, any fear that these overseers, or bishops,
would set people by the ears about territorial titles.&nbsp; They
were much better occupied, by the promulgation of God&rsquo;s
tidings, than to trouble themselves about those things which have
lately become of so much more concern to christian bishops than
the conversion of the heathen; and when those earnest and good
men were assisted by others whom they had imbued with their
religious spirit they lived in one house, in common, on the
free-will offerings of a grateful people.&mdash;The overseer of
the district being their overseer, and his parish, their
parish.</p>
<p>As the religious wants of the people increased, these centres
were found to be inconveniently remote from the
circumference.&nbsp; The teachers, too, considerably increased in
numbers; they demanded as a right that which had been conceded as
a favour; and ambition creeping into their community, as their
riches increased, separate spheres of action because additionally
desirable.&nbsp; So at length, and by degrees, our present
parochial system arose; the sub-divisions bearing the same name,
diocese, or parish, as the original divisions had done.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE PARSON&mdash;ORIGIN
AND USE OF TITHE&mdash;PARSONAGE, RECTORY, OR
VICARAGE&mdash;APPROPRIATION, AND IMPROPRIATION&mdash;A
LIVING&mdash;A SINECURE&mdash;A CURACY WITHOUT THE MEANS OF
CURE.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Parson</span>, <i>persona
ecclesiae</i>,&rdquo; says Blackstone, &ldquo;is one that hath
full possession of all the rights of a parochial church.&nbsp; He
is called parson, <i>persona</i>, because by his person the
church, which is an invisible body, is represented; and he is in
himself a body corporate, in order to protect and defend the
rights of the church, (which he personates,) by a perpetual
succession.&nbsp; He is sometimes called the rector, or governor,
of the church: but the appellation <i>of parson</i> (however it
may be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use)
is the most legal, most beneficial, and most honourable title
that a parish priest can enjoy; because such-a-one (Sir Edward
Coke observes) and he only, is said <i>vicem seu personam
ecclesiae genere</i>.&nbsp; A parson has, during his life, the
freehold in himself of the parsonage-house, the glebe, the
tithes, and other dues.&nbsp; But these are sometimes
<i>appropriated</i>; that is to say, the benefice is perpetually
annexed to some spiritual corporation, either sole or aggregate,
being the patron of the living; which the law esteems equally
capable of providing for the service of the church, as any single
private clergyman.&nbsp; This contrivance seems to have sprung
from the policy of the monastic orders, who have never been
deficient in subtile inventions for the increase of their own
power and emoluments.&nbsp; At the first establishment of the
parochial clergy, the tithes of the parish were distributed in a
four-fold division; one for the use of the bishop, another for
maintaining the fabrick of <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the church, a third for the poor,
and the fourth to provide for the incumbent.&nbsp; When the sees
of the bishops became otherwise amply endowed, they were
prohibited from demanding their usual share of these tithes, and
the division was into three parts only.&nbsp; And hence it was
inferred by the monasteries, that a small part was sufficient for
the officiating priest; and that the remainder might well be
applied to the use of their own fraternities, (the endowment of
which was construed to be a work of the most exalted piety,)
subject to the burthen of repairing the church and providing for
its constant supply.&nbsp; And therefore they begged and bought,
for masses and obits, and sometimes even for money, all the
advowsons within their reach, and then appropriated the benefices
to the use of their own corporation.&nbsp; But, in order to
complete such appropriation effectually, the king&rsquo;s
licence, and consent of the bishop, must first be obtained:
because both the king and the bishop may sometime or other have
an interest, by lapse, in the presentation to the benefice; which
can never happen if it be appropriated to the use of a
corporation, which never dies: and also because the law reposes a
confidence in them, that they will not consent to any thing that
shall be to the prejudice of the church.&nbsp; The consent of the
patron also is necessarily implied, because (as was before
observed) the appropriation can be originally made to none, but
to such spiritual corporation, as is also the patron of the
church; the whole being indeed nothing else, but an allowance for
the patrons to retain the tithes and glebe in their own hands,
without presenting any clerk, they themselves undertaking to
provide for the service of the church.&rdquo; <a
name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a></p>
<p>The great modern historian of our ancestors&mdash;Mr.
Kemble&mdash;also informs us that the tithe&mdash;that property
which cunning and selfish individuals in the course of time, and
little by little, appropriated to their own uses&mdash;was
originally divided into three portions: one for the reparation of
the church; a second to the servants of God; &ldquo;and a third
to God&rsquo;s poor and needy men in thraldom.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Mr. Kemble further states that when the accidental oblations were
replaced by settled payments, whether land or not, they were
directed to be applied in definite proportions to these
objects.</p>
<p>So that the maintenance of the place of religious worship was
as much provided for as the clergy who were to do duty therein;
the poor, too, were equally taken care of, at the same time and
by the same means; for to use the emphatic <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>words of
this great historian, &ldquo;the state had a poor-law and the
clergy were the relieving officers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Barnes, the
registrar of the diocese of Exeter, in his examination before the
select committee of the House of Commons, on the fourth of July,
1851, <a name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a> says, that he believes Blackstone was
mistaken in attributing the charge of the repair of the church to
the tithe; but I think Mr. Kemble has fully established the truth
of the position taken up by that learned Judge.</p>
<p>And this was not all, the bishops, and clergy, were to feed
the poor out of their own incomes.&nbsp; A parson who possessed a
superfluity and did not distribute it to the poor was to be
excommunicated.&nbsp; And the clergy were to practice
handicrafts, &ldquo;not only to keep them out of mischief, but to
help to feed their poor brethren.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of them were
masons; and Mr. Kemble is of opinion that more churches existed
in the tenth century than at the present time.</p>
<p>Before that time there appears to have been &ldquo;a tendency
to speculate in church-building;&rdquo; for the sake of obtaining
&ldquo;the oblations of the faithful;&rdquo; the builders
claiming for themselves that portion of the church&mdash;<i>the
altare</i>&mdash;on which the offerings were laid.</p>
<p>To ensure the support of the churches so built on speculation,
the bishops found it necessary &ldquo;to insist that every church
should be endowed with a sufficient glebe or estate in land: the
amount fixed was one hide, equivalent to the estate of a single
family.&nbsp; Which, properly managed, would support the
presbyter and his attendant clerks.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
glebe-land the bishop could not afterwards interfere with, or
alienate from the church to which it was given.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemble also tells us that by the time of
E&agrave;dg&agrave;r it had become quite a settled thing to pay
tithe; &ldquo;the English prelates having laid a good foundation
for the custom long before they succeeded in obtaining any legal
right from the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also states that &ldquo;cyricsceat,&rdquo; (as the
church-tax was called,) was &ldquo;originally a recognitory
service due to the lord from the tenants of church-lands.&nbsp;
But that in process of time a new character was assumed for it,
and it was claimed of all men alike as a due to the
clergy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then those who refused to pay were
visited by the king&rsquo;s reeve, by the bishop&rsquo;s, and by
the mass-priest of the minster, <a name="citation119b"></a><a
href="#footnote119b" class="citation">[119b]</a> and they took
&ldquo;by force a tenth part for the minster whereunto it was
due.&rdquo;&nbsp; A ninth part only was left for the refractory
subject.&nbsp; While <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the other eight parts were divided
into two.&nbsp; And of this, says the ordinance, &ldquo;let the
landlord seize half, the bishop half, be it a king&rsquo;s man or
a thane&rsquo;s.&rdquo; <a name="citation120"></a><a
href="#footnote120" class="citation">[120]</a></p>
<p>I think it not at all unlikely that those who cultivated the
soil in Paddington received no friendly visits from the tithing
man till the time of Edgar.&nbsp; Dunstan, at this time Abbot of
the Monastery he had restored at Westminster, looked, without
doubt, pretty keenly after the loaves and fishes which were to
feed his little flock; and as the enclosure of the P&aelig;dings
was not too far north to escape his acute glance, he might have
been the first who took tithe here.&nbsp; When Bishop of London,
which he was at the time of his pretended gift of the little
farm, he might, too, have obtained property here, as elsewhere,
by the means above indicated.&nbsp; For, if any of the accounts
we have of him be true, he was evidently not the man to fail in
carrying out any scheme of aggrandisement which he had once
planned, even when the law was not, as it was in this case, in
his favour.&nbsp; And even so late as the tenth century of the
Christian era, some inhabitant of this place might have been
found, whose refractory and pagan spirit prevented his seeing all
the justice and good policy there might be in giving up quietly
the tenth portion of his produce to the monks of
Westminster.&nbsp; Those monks, in Dunstan&rsquo;s time only ten
in number, though able to visit Paddington occasionally, were too
much engaged at Westminster to pay that attention to this little
settlement which was required to teach the inhabitants all their
christian duties.</p>
<p>If this saint, who so honoured the old gentleman&rsquo;s nose,
did in truth first tithe Paddington, he may, in one sense, be
said to have bestowed on his monks a small estate here; for this
impost remained from his time to the Conquest as a fixed charge
on the land.&nbsp; And those who first received tithe here
(being, in all probability, sufficiently impressed with the
necessity of appropriating it according to law) may have built a
chapel in Paddington, with that portion which was legally
assigned for the support of a material structure in which the
services of the church might be <i>performed</i>.</p>
<p>There is yet another &ldquo;probable supposition,&rdquo; viz.
that a speculating builder existed among the P&aelig;dings, even
in those days, who, for the sake of what he could get for
himself, built a chapel here; and the clever Dunstan, or some
other bishop, having caught him in thus defrauding God, and
God&rsquo;s poor, made him give a hide of his land to endow the
place he had built for his own profit: and who knows, if this
were <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>so,
but that this churl (ceorl) was aping his betters in some other
mark, by aspiring to be greater than he really was; for by a law
of Athelstan&rsquo;s a freeman &ldquo;who had the possession and
property of full five hides of land, and had a church, a kitchen,
a bell-house, and a hall, was henceforth entitled to the rank of
a Thane.&rdquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a></p>
<p>We have already seen that a chapel was built and endowed in
Paddington before the ecclesiastical decree of 1222 assigned this
district, with those of Westbourn and Knightsbridge, to St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster.&nbsp; And one may well suppose, if
no Tybourn rector interfered, that a parson was appointed to the
cure, and a district assigned to him, whenever this building was
erected; and to say that one of the monks who lived in the
Convent at Westminster, under the laws and regulations of St.
Benedict, was the person first appointed to this cure, does not,
surely, invalidate that supposition.</p>
<p>Paddington, therefore, may have existed as a rectory and a
separate parish, before the beginning of the thirteenth
century&mdash;before the decree of Stephen Langton, and his
brother-priests, converted it into an appendage to a
vicarage.&nbsp; But this benefice having been thus appropriated
to the use of their own corporation by the company of Benedictin
monks, the rectory, if there had been one, became a sinecure; and
the poor souls in Paddington were transferred to the tender care
of the vicar of St. Margaret&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>How long Paddington remained in this unenviable condition I
cannot say; but we are told by Blackstone, that the appropriating
corporations served the churches &ldquo;in so scandalous a
manner, and the parishes suffered so much by the neglect of
appropriators, that the legislature was forced to interpose: and
accordingly it is enacted by statute 15th Richard II, cap. 6,
that in all appropriations of churches, the diocesan bishop,
shall ordain (in proportion to the value of the church) a
competent sum to be distributed among the poor parishioners,
annually; and that the vicarage shall be <i>sufficiently</i>
endowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this great Judge adds, &ldquo;It seems
the parish were frequently sufferers, not only by the want of
divine service, but also by witholding those alms, for which,
among other purposes, the payment of tithes was originally
imposed: and therefore in this Act a pension is directed to be
distributed among the poor <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>parochians, as well as a sufficient
stipend to the vicar.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he goes on to say,
&ldquo;but he being liable to be removed at the pleasure of the
appropriator, was not likely to insist too rigidly on the legal
sufficiency of the stipend: and therefore by statute 4, Henry IV,
cap. 12, it is ordained, that the vicar shall be a secular
person, not a member of any religious house; that he shall be
vicar perpetual, not removable at the caprice of the monastery;
and that he shall be canonically instituted and inducted, and be
sufficiently endowed, at the discretion of the ordinary, for
these three express purposes, to do divine service, to inform the
people, and to keep hospitality.&nbsp; The endowments in
consequence of these statutes have usually been a portion of the
glebe, or land, belonging to the parsonage, and a particular
share of the tithes, which the appropriates found it most
troublesome to collect, and which are therefore generally called
privy or small tithes; the greater, or predial, tithes being
still reserved to their own use.&rdquo; <a
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a>&nbsp; And thus, the appropriates of
those days were compelled by statute to provide, in some sort,
both for the souls and bodies of those, from whom proceeded the
revenues of the church.</p>
<p>But before these statutes could be obtained, the voice of
Wickliffe had been heard not only at Lutterworth, but in London
and Westminster; and the degenerate Church, which this worthy
rector denounced, could no longer resist some of those reforms,
which the State had long seen to be necessary. <a
name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b"
class="citation">[122b]</a></p>
<p>We have seen by Tanner&rsquo;s note that Paddington was spoken
of as a parish in the time of Richard the second, and by the
Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry the eighth that the rectory, no
longer an appendage to St. Margaret&rsquo;s, yielded, like the
manor, a separate revenue to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Since, then, the ancient laws were totally disregarded, and
tithe, and other church property, was perverted to individual
uses for so long a period with perfect impunity, we cannot be
surprised to find these more recent appointments were gradually
evaded, or abused; so that, step by step, the doings of that
church, which still boasts of its rule and guide over millions of
minds, was so utterly detested in this country that even the
genius of a Wolsey could not save it from perdition.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>And
what secures and sustains the present structure?&nbsp; How has
the church in Paddington been supported since the
Reformation?</p>
<p>We have already seen that the rectory was disposed of, with
the manor, by Henry the eighth, to Sir Edward and Dame
Baynton.&nbsp; It thus became <i>impropriate</i>. <a
name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a></p>
<p>But it was again appropriated; this time by a corporation
sole.&nbsp; For, when the bishops of London claimed the rectory
of Paddington as a &ldquo;member and appurtenance&rdquo; of the
manor, did they not become the real rectors of the parish?&nbsp;
Certainly, from time to time, since Bishop Sheldon&rsquo;s day,
if not before, they have leased the rectory with the manor, and
exercised the right of appointing the curate here.&nbsp; Are they
not, then, accountable for the proper application of the rectory
revenues?&nbsp; And how have these revenues been applied?</p>
<p>We are informed that the fourth protestant bishop of London
thought Paddington would make a comfortable retiring pension for
his porter; and the enemies of Bishop Aylmer brought this misdeed
as one of their many accusations against him.&nbsp; His faithful
biographer, Strype, admitting the fact, thus defends the
bishop:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As for the charge, that the bishop made his
porter a minister; all things considered he thought it to be
justifiable and lawfully done, and not to lack example of many
such that had been after that sort admitted, both since the
Queen&rsquo;s coming to the crown, by many good bishops, and by
sound histories ecclesiastical.&nbsp; That where churches, by
reason of persecution, or multitudes of Hamlets and free chapels,
had commonly very small stipends for their ministers, honest
godly men, upon the discretion of the governors of the church,
had been, and might be, brought in to serve, in the want of
learned men, in prayer, administration of the sacraments, good
example of life, and in some sort of exhortation.&nbsp; And this
man therefore when the bishop found him by good and long
experience to be one that pleased God, to be conversant in the
scriptures, and of very honest life and conversation, he allowed
of him to serve in a small congregation at Paddington, where
commonly for the meanness of the stipend no preacher could be
had; as in many places it came to pass, where the parsonage was
impropriate, and the provision for the vicar or curate very
small.&nbsp; And how that good man behaved himself there, time
and trial proved him; for he continued in that place with <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the good
liking of the people eight or more years till he grew dull of
sight for age, and thereby unable to serve any longer.&rdquo; <a
name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a"
class="citation">[124a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Fletcher, Bancroft, Vaughan, Ravis, Abbot, and King did
for Paddington, I cannot tell.&nbsp; But the truth is, that the
protestant bishops, no more than the popish abbots, have applied
the revenues of the church to their original purposes.&nbsp; It
is true that much of the revenue of the church vanished at the
Reformation.&nbsp; The great Reformers of the Church did not
possess the princely fortunes of their predecessors; or of the
present bishops. <a name="citation124b"></a><a
href="#footnote124b" class="citation">[124b]</a>&nbsp; But the
reformed bishops did not relinquish the old practice of receiving
fines, for granting life-leases, when the impropriate leases
dropped in.&nbsp; Rectory lands, and tithes, were still badly
managed; and the fines raised by leasing them were appropriated,
as heretofore, to individual uses.&nbsp; To such an extent was
this &ldquo;waste of church lands&rdquo; carried that the people
saw little good had been done, in this respect, by that
revolution which had been sanctioned by Henry the eighth.</p>
<p>During the next reformation another survey of ecclesiastical
property was made.&nbsp; Commissioners were appointed in 1649, by
the parliament, to enquire into the nature of ecclesiastical
benefices; and from their report we learn the condition of the
&ldquo;living of Paddington&rdquo; at that time.</p>
<p>The following survey is printed from the original still
existing with the Records in the Rolls&rsquo; Chapel.&nbsp; The
portion in italics being so much defaced in the original document

<p>This authentic record is something more than a mere
curiosity.&nbsp; It establishes several important facts; and
enables the reader to form a just estimate of the care taken of
the cure of souls in Paddington, by bishop Mountain.</p>
<p>I think it not at all improbable that the &ldquo;Vicarage
House&rdquo; had been made into &ldquo;a house for <i>two</i>
tenants,&rdquo; by Sir Rowland St. John; for, so far as I can
discover, he was the first lessee who resided on the Paddington
estate.&nbsp; The lords of the manor had preferred to live in the
monastery, and the episcopal palace; and their lessees were only
middle-men, whose object was&mdash;as the object of this class
very frequently has been&mdash;to get as much out of the
land-workers as possible, and give as little as possible in
return.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>It is
my opinion, however, that Sir Rowland St. John added very
considerably to the parsonage-house; and adopted it as his own
residence, (no uncommon thing at this period), by which it
arrived at the dignity of a manor-house; and, as the bishop had
&ldquo;left it unto his tenants&rdquo; to do what they pleased
for the cure of souls, Sir Rowland, also in compliance with the
fashion of the time, kindly gave house-room to some poor
half-starved curate, who had never taken upon himself the
ministry as a money-getting profession, or having done so had
found his expectations most woefully deceived.&nbsp; The pay of
his &ldquo;reading minister&rdquo; may astonish those who do not
remember the account given by Mr. Macaulay, or some equally
trust-worthy author, of the condition of the great majority of
the clergy in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The learned historian just referred to, states, what one may
readily believe, seeing what the lords of Paddington and
Marylebone paid the minister of those places, that &ldquo;for one
who made the figure of a gentleman, ten were menial
servants;&rdquo; and he adds, &ldquo;a large proportion of those
divines who had no benefices, or whose benefices were too small
to afford a comfortable revenue, lived in the houses of
laymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ordinary,&rdquo; in his &ldquo;discretion,&rdquo;
or in his hurry to secure a more lucrative preferment for
himself&mdash;the see of London in Dr. Mountain&rsquo;s time was
not the richest in England, and therefore not worth sticking
to&mdash;had forgotten to make any provision for that cure of
souls in Paddington, which devolved on him, and for which he was
paid.&nbsp; &ldquo;The reading minister;&rdquo; and afterwards
Mr. Anthony Dodd, &ldquo;the preaching minister,&rdquo; were glad
therefore to become tenants in the great man&rsquo;s house;
having no rectory-house to themselves, and not being provided
with a sufficiency of the rectory profits &ldquo;to do divine
service, to inform the people, and keep hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, indeed, &ldquo;a young Levite, such was the
phrase in use, might be had for his board, a small garret, and
ten pounds a year, and might not only perform his own
professional functions, might not only be the most patient of
butts and of listeners, might not only be always ready in fine
weather for the bowls, and in rainy weather for the shovel-board,
but might also save the expense of a gardener or a groom.&nbsp;
Sometimes the reverend man nailed up the apricots, and sometimes
he curried the coach horses; he cast up the farrier&rsquo;s
bills; he walked ten miles with a message or parcel; he was
permitted to dine with the family, but he was expected to content
himself with the plainest fare, he might fill <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>himself
with the corned beef and the carrots, but as soon as the tarts
and cheese-cakes make their appearance he quitted his seat, and
stood aloof till he was summoned to return thanks for the repast,
from a great part of which he had been excluded.&rdquo; <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a></p>
<p>This certainly was not a very cheerful state of things for the
working clergy and the people; and, although the <i>high
dignitaries of the church</i> had few kind words to bestow on
Cromwell, or the Commonwealth, it will be observed that the
clergy and the people of Paddington had no reason to regret the
establishment of the Parliamentary Commission.&nbsp; The
commissioners wished to see the tithes let at something like
their real value: a new church built out of the rectory funds;
and &ldquo;a godly able preaching minister&rdquo; appointed,
whose pay was to be something more than the paltry stipend
allowed by the lessee, previous to the Revolution; or than poor
Mr. Anthony Dodd&rsquo;s liberal salary of twenty-eight pounds
per annum, for his two full services and two sermons &ldquo;every
Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, if the suggestions of the commissioners were not
completely carried out, the report of 1649 was not entirely
unheeded, even after the restoration of the episcopacy; for the
trustworthy public notary, Newcourt, tells us that Bishop Sheldon
bound his nephews &ldquo;to pay the curate here eighty pounds per
year, at the four most usual feasts, viz. twenty pounds per
quarter;&rdquo; and he also informs us that &ldquo;The church was
but small and being very old and ruinious was about the year 1678
pulled down and new built from the ground, at the cost and
charges of Joseph Sheldon, knight, sometime Lord Mayor of the
City of London, and his brother, Mr. Daniel Sheldon, then lessees
of the manor of Paddington.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one would have
thought that the memory of these events would have been preserved
in less crazy heads than Mr. Dick&rsquo;s; that the good example
set to his successors by Bishop Sheldon would have been followed;
and as the population of this place increased, and the value of
the rectory-lands was thereby increased, the religious wants of
the people would have been provided for out of these increased
funds.</p>
<p>Two hundred pounds per annum, and the quantity of waste land
for which Bishop Porteus and his lessees agreed to give the
parish fifteen pounds a-year, is, as we have already seen, all
that the liberal bishops of London, for the last century, have
provided for the cure of fifty thousand souls, <a
name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a> out of an <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>estate which now yearly brings in
thirty thousand pounds; and which, like the population, must
increase for many years to come.&nbsp; Such paltry provisions for
the cure of souls in Paddington will be a lasting monument of
disgrace to all parties concerned in these transactions.</p>
<p>To smooth down the unmitigated selfishness developed in the
several private Acts of Parliament, which we have examined in a
previous part of this Work, it has been said &ldquo;the system
was in fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when it was enacted, that two
hundred acres of land which had been claimed by the church might
be occupied by human beings, instead of cows and cabbage;
&ldquo;the system&rdquo; could as easily have provided suitably
for the religious education of the contemplated dwellers on this
soil, as it did for the increase in the stipend of a single
curate; or as it did for the transfer of two-thirds of the estate
into the hands of lay lessees; and, when permission was given by
another Act, to extend the power of granting building leases to
four hundred acres of this estate, we find the rector of the
parish, the lord of the manor, the bishop of London&mdash;three
important personages in one&mdash;content with providing out of
that estate an increased salary of eighty pounds a-year for a
single curate; and with obtaining permission to give, &ldquo;in
case of need or convenience,&rdquo; land which cost the owners of
this estate fifteen pounds a year, I think the most charitable
must say, that the inhabitants of this parish are not indebted to
&ldquo;the system&rdquo; alone, for all the paternal care which
their governors have bestowed on them and the cure of their
souls.</p>
<p>Newcourt tells us Paddington &ldquo;is exempt from the
Archdeacon, and wholly subject to the Bishop of London and his
Commissary;&rdquo; and that the church is a donative of curacy in
the gift of the bishops of that see, and is &ldquo;supplied by a
curate by virtue of the bishop&rsquo;s license, wherein is
committed to him the <i>cura animarum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Paddington has lost much by not having been overlooked
by the archdeacon&mdash;&ldquo;the bishop&rsquo;s
eye&rdquo;&mdash;I cannot pretend to say; but we see that the
rectory of Paddington, like that of many other places, overlooked
by archdeacons, has been allowed to become a sinecure; and the
curacy to exist without the means of cure; that the parson is a
triune body; and that <i>the rights</i> of the parochial church
belong much more to the bishop, and his lay lessees, than to the
excellent minister, to whom the &ldquo;cure of souls,&rdquo; with
a stipend few gentlemen could live on, and none perform the
necessary <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>duties with, is so considerately bestowed.&nbsp; And,
with such scandals as this daily staring us in the face, is it
very surprising that the law, which heretofore reposed confidence
in bishops, and assumed, &ldquo;that they will not consent to
anything that shall be to the prejudice of the church,&rdquo;
should have at length begun to discover, that its confidence has
been somewhat misplaced, and that all bishops cannot be
trusted?</p>
<p>It certainly has been discovered that Parliamentary enquiries
are necessary in our day; and it has been found out, even by
ecclesiastics, that the appointment of ecclesiastical
commissioners could no longer be delayed if the church was to be
saved.&nbsp; But ecclesiastical commissioners are but men; the
people, therefore, in every parish in England should themselves
look into their own ecclesiastical affairs; and demand with one
united voice the fulfilment of those religious duties to God and
God&rsquo;s poor, which devolve on those who claim the lands of
the church.&nbsp; Sooner or later a demand so just must be fully
recognised; and governors will assuredly arise, who will have
both the power and the will to execute justice.</p>
<p>Such malversations as those which have been recently exposed
by the Rev. Mr. Whiston, and others, cannot last for ever; and
the sooner the whole system is altered, if it be the system that
is in fault, the better for all parties.</p>
<p>By returns moved for by our honourable member, Sir B. Hall,
(to whom the whole country is deeply indebted for the information
on ecclesiastical affairs which he has brought to light,) we find
that the portion of the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Revenues</span> of the <span
class="smcap">See</span> of <span class="smcap">London</span>,
for the seven years ending thirty-first December, 1850,&rdquo;
arising from the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Share of Paddington
Rents</span>, &amp;c.&rdquo; amounted to &pound;56,939 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, while the &ldquo;share of the various payments in
respect of share of Paddington estate,&rdquo; for the same
period, amounted to &pound;1742 10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The
correctness of that return is certified to, and signed &ldquo;C.
J. London.&rdquo; <a name="citation129"></a><a
href="#footnote129" class="citation">[129]</a></p>
<p>The lay lessees received double this sum, as per agreement, so
that for seven years &pound;170,817 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> has
been paid, <i>chiefly in the shape of increased house-rent be it
observed</i>, by that portion of the people of Paddington, who
have had the felicity of living on &ldquo;The Bishop&rsquo;s
Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A law, which already exists, will affect the income of the
next occupant of the See of London, and therefore his relations
to the rectory of Paddington; and it has been hinted that
something may be done, in that event, for this parish.&nbsp; <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>But the
people of Paddington do not desire such patchwork
arrangements.&nbsp; They want that which the whole country is
asking for, and which cannot be much longer delayed&mdash;a law
to regulate the whole of the estates of the church; and there is
one pleasing anticipation for the people of Paddington in the
contemplation of such a measure; viz. that, whatever may be the
effect of that law, it cannot make <i>their</i> position worse
than it is at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not worth while to enter into
an elaborate enquiry, to shew that the parish of Paddington was
at one time included in the parish of Tybourn, and that the
ancient Tybourn church was the mother-church of the whole of
those districts, now included in the parishes of St. Mary
Abbot&rsquo;s Kensington, Paddington, and Marylebone; but the
facts and arguments which have been already adduced to prove that
Westbourn and Tybourn were but synonymous terms; and that the
modern manor of Paddington was but a portion of the ancient
Tybourn manor, may serve to sanction such a supposition.</p>
<p>Maitland, Lysons, and other authors, tell us that the ancient
church of Tybourn was situated near the present Marylebone
Court-house&mdash;i.e. beside <i>the modern</i> Tybourn; but the
only evidence these authorities condescend to give in support of
their opinion, is, that in 1729, &ldquo;a great quantity of bones
were dug up at this place.&rdquo;&nbsp; They offer no proof,
however, that these bones belonged to the inhabitants of the
ancient village of Tybourn; neither do they attempt to shew that
they were not the remains of some of those who had died in London
of the plague, which raged there in the previous century.&nbsp; A
writer in the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, part 1, p. 315, 1809,
seems to me, to be quietly quizzing those antiquarians who
accepted this story of the bones, when he tells <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>the public
that &ldquo;in all ancient documents, Mary la bonne (Mary the
Good) is called Sancta Maria de Ossibus, (Saint Mary of
Bones).&rdquo;&nbsp; Lysons, however, does not see the joke, for
he gravely replied in his second edition, &ldquo;I have never
seen any in which it is so described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be worthy of remark, that the ancient Tybourn church,
wherever it was situated, was taken down in the year 1400, by
order of the Lord Chancellor, Bishop Braybrook, when the honors
and estates of the noble family who built and endowed this
church, were in the keeping of a youth barely seventeen years of
age; <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a> and that the Westminster monks never,
either by hook or by crook, obtained possession of this ancient
advowson.&nbsp; A rival establishment, however, was built either
for them, or by them, on their newly acquired property at
Paddington, and, as we have already seen, the spiritual direction
of the Paddington district was assigned to them as early as 1222;
previous to which time a place of worship had been built here;
and for upwards of six hundred years this small house, erected
both for public worship and public instruction, was deemed
sufficient for rich and poor, saint and sinner, and to it an
unbought spot of consecrated ground was annexed, the quiet
resting-place of all those who had lived in Paddington.</p>
<p>So pretty was the church, and so tranquil seemed this country
burial-place, not a century since, that many of those who
witnessed the abominations committed in the consecrated grounds
of London and Westminster, longed to secure for their corruptible
bodies a nook in this village church-yard; and so manifest was
this desire, during the whole of the last century that, though
the population of Paddington was increasing, the burials here far
exceeded the baptisms.</p>
<p>In Lysons&rsquo; &ldquo;Environs,&rdquo; this fact stands
exemplified thus&mdash;</p>

this addition of motionless mortality to the soil, like the
development of its resources by the increase of active life,
formed but an additional inducement to its insatiable lords to
increase their demands upon the people; for I find <i>from
records still preserved</i>, <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a> that after they
had obtained the Act which bound the inhabitants of Paddington to
pay a rent-charge for their &ldquo;pretty church-yard;&rdquo; and
after the infamous Act of 1795, the lord and his lessees were
urgent in their demands for a share of those fees, which were
obliged to be levied on the relatives of the dead, to secure the
performance of those duties which these rectors were already well
paid to perform.</p>
<p>Of the earliest Christian temple erected in Paddington, I have
nothing more to say than what I have already said, excepting
this, that in all probability it was built and endowed by the
first possessors of &ldquo;the Paddington Estate,&rdquo; whoever
they were; and, whatever were their sins respecting that estate,
<i>they</i> must be exonerated from that amount of refined
selfishness which has enabled others to take the property
dedicated to God, and God&rsquo;s poor, and leave the people to
their own resources for providing themselves with places of
worship, and &ldquo;the cup of charity&rdquo; for the aged and
infirm.</p>
<h4>St. Katherine&rsquo;s, and St. James&rsquo;s.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;old and ruinous&rdquo; church, pulled down about
1678, was, in the opinion of that accurate observer, Newcourt,
dedicated to St. Katherine; for, says he, &ldquo;I observed the
picture of St. Katherine to be set up in painted glass, at the
top of the middle panel of the east window in the chancel, where
oftentimes the Saint, to which any church is dedicated, is
placed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newcourt does not tell us to whom the church, &ldquo;new-built
from the ground,&rdquo; was dedicated; but he saw none of the
causes at work which ensured its destruction in rather more than
a century; and it could not have been imagined by him that a
policy would be inaugurated, and completed, within a century and
a half of the time at which he wrote, which would be sorely
puzzled to account for the existence of a church built by those
who were in receipt of the rectorial revenues.&nbsp; Such a
puzzle was not allowed to exist.&nbsp; Doubtlessly, Newcourt
thought <i>the name</i> would have existed more than one hundred
and ten years&mdash;the time the church was allowed to
stand&mdash;and indeed it does now exist in the <i>new</i> parish
church; but Newcourt omits to give it.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>We
find, however, by Willis&rsquo;s Thesaurus of 1763, and by
Lysons, that the Sheldon church was dedicated to St. James.</p>
<p>This country church served Hogarth and Jane Thornhill for a
Gretna-Green; for here they were married, much against Sir
James&rsquo;s will, it is said, <a name="citation134"></a><a

twenty-third of March, 1729.</p>
<p>Chaterlain&rsquo;s series of views, dated 1750, contains
<i>two</i> of this church; a near north-west view, not mentioned
in the King&rsquo;s Catalogue, British Museum; and a distant view
from the green, a copy of which is to be found in the
King&rsquo;s collection.</p>
<h4>St. Mary&rsquo;s.</h4>
<p>On the twenty-sixth day of February, in the twenty-eighth year
of his reign, George the third, granted by his letters patent to
the Rev. Thomas Hayter, the curate of the parish; the Rev. John
Shepherd, the assistant curate; and certain others; the power to
beg &ldquo;from house to house throughout England, our town of
Berwick-upon-Tweed, &amp;c.&rdquo; to enable them to rebuild the
parish church, which this Brief, and the preamble of the
twenty-eighth Geo. III, cap. 74&mdash;&ldquo;An Act for
rebuilding the parish church of <i>Paddington</i>, in the county
of <i>Middlesex</i>, and for enlarging the church-yard of the
said parish,&rdquo;&mdash;tell us &ldquo;is a very ancient
structure, and in such a decayed state, that it cannot be
effectually repaired, but must be taken down and rebuilt; besides
which, the same is so small, that one-fourth of the present
inhabitants within the said parish cannot assemble therein for
Divine worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down to this time, the lords of the Paddington soil, or their
lessees, had furnished the tenants, who lived on this
church-land, with some sort of church accommodation; but another
church was now required and was to be built, although this
<i>very ancient</i> and <i>decayed structure</i> was but one
hundred and ten years old; and the question naturally arose, who
was to build it?&nbsp; The then lessees; as the lessees had done
in 1678?&nbsp; The &ldquo;Lord of the manor of Paddington;&rdquo;
as the then bishop is called?&nbsp; Or these together?&nbsp;
Neither the one, nor the other, nor the two combined.&nbsp; It is
no longer those who hold &ldquo;the rectorial and other
lands,&rdquo; and whose income from those lands has been
increasing ever since the time of Bishop Sheldon, who are to
build churches in Paddington.&nbsp; The lord and his lessees <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>know their
duty better than that.&nbsp; Begging boxes are to be sent
&ldquo;from house to house throughout England;&rdquo; and as that
does not succeed, those to whom a portion of the increased
accommodation is to be offered, are to be induced or compelled to
furnish the necessary funds.&nbsp; Moreover, at the expense of
the people, (for the Act expressly declares the pews shall be
&ldquo;rent-free,&rdquo;) comfortable accommodation, &ldquo;in or
near the chancel,&rdquo; is to be provided for the lord of the
manor of Paddington, &ldquo;or his or their lessee or
lessees.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although there is now no
Dunstan&rsquo;s bailiff to dread, let those who doubt that the
law had power in Paddington at the end of the last century, as it
has now, &ldquo;to take by force&rdquo; this extra and new
church-tax, look to the fourteenth, thirty-fourth, and other
sections of this <i>public</i> Act; the <i>first</i> of the
Paddington church building Acts.</p>
<p>Up to one shilling in the pound, on &ldquo;the yearly rent of
lands, houses, shops, warehouses, vaults, mills, and other
tenements,&rdquo; forty-five trustees&mdash;six of whom were
clergymen&mdash;&ldquo;or any <i>five</i> or more of them,&rdquo;
they, and their successors, had power to <i>assess</i>, and for
the sum assessed had power to <i>distress</i>, &ldquo;in order to
accomplish the good and pious purposes of this Act.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Provided always, that the sum raised by this and other means set
forth in this Act, &ldquo;shall not exceed in the whole the sum
of four thousand five hundred pounds, including the charges in
the enclosing the said waste ground and other incidental charges,
and of the procuring, obtaining, and passing this Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said waste ground,&rdquo; here spoken of, being
<i>a portion of the enclosed green</i> <a
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> nicely measured and carved
out&mdash;vide Act&mdash;which &ldquo;The Right Reverend
Father-in-God, Beilby, Lord Bishop of London, is willing and
desirous&rdquo; to give; and which he does give at a rent of six
shillings a year.&nbsp; First, having in this Act, and for the
first time anywhere, so far as I can discover, put in his claim
to be &ldquo;entitled to the waste ground within the said parish
(subject to commonage thereon).&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sum to which this Act limited the taxing, was found to
be insufficient; and another Act was required, &ldquo;for
enlarging the powers of, and rendering more effectual, an Act,
made in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of his present
Majesty, entituled, An Act for re-building the Parish Church of
Paddington, &amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, the thirty-third
Geo. III, cap. 43, dated thirtieth April, 1793, contains all the
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>whining
for further powers, which so commonly saluted the ears of his
Majesty&rsquo;s faithful Lords and Commons when church-building
Acts had to be separately passed. <a name="citation136"></a><a
href="#footnote136" class="citation">[136]</a></p>
<p>And the prayer of those who asked, was answered; and a further
sum was to be raised by the means provided in the previous Act;
but with this additional screw&mdash;&ldquo;That in every case
where a justice or justices of the peace shall grant a warrant or
warrants of distress, for recovering of any rate or assessment
made under the said former or this Act, and a sufficient distress
cannot be found, it shall be lawful for such justice or justices
of the peace to commit the person or persons, against whom or
whose goods and chattels such warrant or warrants of distress may
have been issued, to the common gaol or house of correction for
the said county, there to remain without bail or mainprize, for
any time not exceeding one month, <i>or until payment of such
rate or assessment</i>, <i>and the costs and charges attending
the recovery thereof</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Section 2.</p>
<p>Further, desecration of the church-yard was permitted; and in
spite of all the thought which had been bestowed on the monuments
and tombstones in the previous Act, any decayed vault, tombstone,
or grave, which offended the sight of the officials, was now to
be taken down, or removed, after six months&rsquo; notice to
repair had been given to &ldquo;the owner or owners of such
vaults.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the churchwarden or churchwardens, for
the time being, were empowered &ldquo;to sell and dispose of such
vaults for the best price that can be got, and to apply the money
arising therefrom towards rebuilding or repairing the said parish
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And why were these extraordinary powers granted?&nbsp; Because
the inhabitants of Paddington were not &ldquo;capable of raising
without the further aid of Parliament,&rdquo; or were not willing
to raise, &ldquo;a further sum of one thousand five hundred
pounds,&rdquo; to defray the expences required to <i>finish</i>
the church-yard; and to pay &ldquo;a considerable sum of money
due on account;&rdquo; and because those who took the profits of
&ldquo;the rectorial and other lands,&rdquo; did not think it
their duty to pay it for them.</p>
<p>How much more than these sums Saint Mary&rsquo;s has cost, I
cannot say; but I presume they very nearly covered all the <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>original
expenses, as Lysons was informed by a most excellent
authority&mdash;a gentleman, who, in imitation of the manifold
offices held by the lord of the manor, was assistant curate,
parish-clerk, sexton, and vestry-clerk at the same time <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a>&mdash;that the total sum expended,
amounted to &pound;6000.</p>
<p>So much admired was this church at the time it was built; and
so picturesque an object it is said to have been,
&ldquo;particularly from the Oxford, Edgeware, and Harrow
roads;&rdquo; that almost all the periodicals of the day take
some notice of it.</p>
<p>The Universal Magazine for January, 1793, gives an engraving
of it, and the village-stocks, by Eastgate, from a drawing by
Earl; and in the same Number there is an account of the building,
in which the first stone is said to have been laid &ldquo;on the
twelfth of August, 1788,&rdquo; and the consecration to have been
&ldquo;in Easter week, 1790.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lysons, however, tells
us, Saint Mary&rsquo;s was consecrated on the twenty-seventh of
April, 1791; the first stone having been laid, according to him,
on the twentieth day of October, 1788.&nbsp; As to the date of
consecration, Lysons is certainly right, as most likely he is in
the other statement, having had so good an authority as the
curate, parish-clerk, &amp;c., &amp;c. to furnish him with these
and other facts which occurred in Paddington about the time at
which he wrote.&nbsp; On the day this church was consecrated, a
sermon was preached in it, and a collection made for the benefit
of the Sunday School.</p>
<p>The following description of this church, given by the writer
in the Universal Magazine, was, in all probability, nearly
correct, when written: &ldquo;It is seated on an eminence, finely
embosomed in venerable elms.&nbsp; Its figure is composed of a
square of about fifty feet.&nbsp; The centres, on each side of
the square, are projecting parallelograms, which give recesses
for an altar, a vestry, and two stair-cases.&nbsp; The roof
terminates with a cupola and vane: on each of the sides is a
door.&nbsp; That facing the south is decorated with a portico
composed of the Tuscan and Doric orders, having niches on the
sides.&nbsp; The west has an arched window, under which is a
circular portico of four columns, agreeable to the former
composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Mr.
John Plaw, of King Street, Westminster, is said to have been the
architect in this account; but Lysons, and Tennant, say Mr.
Wapshot, designed this mixed specimen of Tuscan, Doric, and
non-descript architecture.</p>
<p>The European Magazine, not to be behind its contemporaries in
delineations of the picturesque and beautiful, has an etching of
the &ldquo;New Church at Paddington&rdquo; by Malcolm; in which
he has also shewn what one of the Paddington ponds, already
spoken of as existing in the time of Edward VI, was &ldquo;in the
good King George&rsquo;s reign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old church and the new church are both engraved in the
Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, supplement, 1795.&nbsp; The notice of
the church there given, seems to have been taken from Lysons,
perhaps it was supplied by him; but there is this additional
statement, viz.&mdash;that the monuments which existed in the
former church were placed in a light vault underneath the present
structure.</p>
<p>And this church which has been built but sixty-one years and a
few months, has been for the last three or four years in
jeopardy&mdash;not of falling, but of sharing the fate of its
predecessor; the same causes having been at work to effect its
dissolution, which led to the removal of the Sheldon
church:&mdash;viz., a population ill provided with
church-accommodation&mdash;a new parish church
built&mdash;architects and builders, anxious to shew their skill,
still further&mdash;influential inhabitants interested in the
furtherance of their schemes, ready and willing to vote the
requisite supplies out of their neighbours&rsquo; pockets&mdash;a
tempting piece of ground in the immediate vicinity, &ldquo;doing
nothing&rdquo;&mdash;a notion, in some minds, that sundry
reminiscences, connected therewith, might thus be
obliterated&mdash;and the prospect of an increase in burial-fees
and pew-rents.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, better counsels have prevailed; and this
amount of consecrated property is not yet doomed to be
destroyed.&nbsp; St Mary&rsquo;s, though no longer the parish
church, is to remain, a standing monument to the erudition of
those who once governed Paddington.&nbsp; These guardians of the
church and poor, not only knew which way the wind blew without
the assistance of a lettered vane; but understood Greek; as the
unlettered vane, and the inscription on the fa&ccedil;ade,
testify.&nbsp; But as all <i>the multitude</i> who have attended
St. Mary&rsquo;s since it was built, have not been able to sing,
in the original, that song of the heavenly host which contains
the essence of Christianity; and as the English church does not
profess to teach people unknown tongues, or object to <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>their
worshiping God in their own, it would have been as well to have
given them some key to those golden characters, which are so
conspicuously placed on the fa&ccedil;ade of this Pseudo-Greek
temple.&nbsp; Those who desire, or require a translation to that
divine announcement, which has been so long hidden in the
original, will find it in the English edition of Luke&rsquo;s
epistle to Theophilus, second chapter, and fourteenth verse.</p>
<p>The church-yard was enlarged, as already noticed, by virtue of
the powers of the fiftieth Geo. III., cap. 44.&nbsp; This Act,
which was obtained on the eighteenth of April, 1810, states, that
whereas the population of the parish of Paddington, hath lately
much increased <i>and is likely still further to increase</i>, it
is expedient that <span class="smcap">the Church-yard</span> of
the said parish should be further enlarged.&rdquo;&nbsp; But not
a word about the enlargement of the church, or increased
church-accommodation, notwithstanding the then present, and
future state of the parish, is so clearly seen; and although St.
Mary&rsquo;s could now no more hold one-fourth of the
inhabitants, than St. James&rsquo; had done.&nbsp; Seven hundred
and forty pounds had been for three years the average annual
income from this grave-yard; the half of which was received by
the curate, to make up for the mean stipend allowed by the
rectors; the remaining half being paid to the rectors themselves,
for their land; so that to endanger this source of income, was a
thing not to be dreamed of.&nbsp; This appropriation of the
burial fees, continued till the whole of the church-yard was paid
for; since which time the half of the fees has been applied to
the ordinary expenses of the church; the other half going, as
before, to the incumbent; and this may account for the following
entry in the Churchwardens&rsquo; account, for 1840.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Paid to parish solicitor, his bill in
respect of various cemetery-bills in Parliament, &pound;144
9<i>s.</i>&nbsp; 0<i>d.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This yard, no longer the villagers&rsquo; unbought
resting-place, in which the almost sacred yew-tree <a
name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a> grew, had now become necessary for the
support of the church; it must be increased therefore, and every
inch of ground must be made the best of.&nbsp; Besides securing
this income, another object was attempted to be gained by this
Act.&nbsp; The trustees were empowered to contract for the
purchase of any quantity of land, &ldquo;not exceeding three
acres in the whole, <i>with</i> or without <i>buildings
thereon</i>;&rdquo; and &ldquo;corporations, &amp;c., were
empowered to sell and <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>convey.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
&ldquo;house for two tenants called the vicarage house;&rdquo;
had long since been converted into the manor-house; and
occupants, more profitable to the Paddington Estate, than the
curate, had been found for it; and the house which I believe was
afterwards built for a &ldquo;Parsonage-house,&rdquo;&mdash;a
house still standing close to the spot where the old church
stood, and which is depicted in John Carey&rsquo;s map of 1797,
as the &ldquo;Parsonage,&rdquo;&mdash;had been, before this time,
converted into the &ldquo;manor farm-house.&rdquo; <a
name="citation140a"></a><a href="#footnote140a"
class="citation">[140a]</a>&nbsp; In fact, the curate had no
residence provided for him in the parish.&nbsp; But at the time
of passing this Act, the old manor-house had been unoccupied for
some time, and was rapidly falling to decay for want of a tenant,
whose interest it was to keep it in repair; <a
name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b"
class="citation">[140b]</a> and the bishop and his lessees having
no further use for it, were anxious to sell; and so the manor
house, with a portion of its grounds, was purchased by the church
trustees.</p>
<p>The inhabitants, now, much to the chagrin of the schemers,
began to find out which way the wind blew; and seeing, (when it
was too late,) how their birthright had been sold, resolved to
take this little bargain into their special
consideration&mdash;determining, if possible, to make the best of
it, as it had been bought, and to have some control over the
receipts and the mode of levying the income which was to be
derived from the purchase.</p>
<p>This resolution had the effect of producing many parish
squabbles, into some of which even the venerable diocesan himself
was dragged.&nbsp; In attempting to regulate the fees to be paid
for burials in &ldquo;the new ground,&rdquo; certain resolutions
were passed by the inhabitants in vestry assembled, by which the
bishop &ldquo;feels himself affronted;&rdquo; and he declares, he
&ldquo;will not consecrate the new ground, till the offensive
resolution is rescinded.&rdquo;&nbsp; The resolution is not, at
once, rescinded.&nbsp; It is resolved that it shall not be.&nbsp;
But the bishop is to be informed no offence was intended.&nbsp;
All, indeed, that was intended by the people of Paddington, at
that time, seems to have been expressed by a resolution of May,
1813; to the effect that &ldquo;it would be a dereliction of
their duty not to leave to posterity the same <i>privileges</i>
they have enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to speak of privileges now, was thought to be a joke by
those who had to deal with people, who, either in their <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>innocence,
or ignorance, had permitted themselves to be cajoled out of far
greater privileges than this.&nbsp; Most assuredly, one could
scarcely expect that such people, though repentant, would be
listened to; and the matter was ended by a peremptory message
from the bishop, in which he declares, &ldquo;he knows of no
privilege belonging to the parish of Paddington, or any other
parish respecting the settlement of their own fees;&rdquo; and
that such fees will not be legal, unless confirmed by his
Court.</p>
<p>So, although the act for purchasing this ground passed on the
eighteenth of April, 1810, no portion of the new burial ground
was consecrated till the 9th of November, 1813; and the notion of
inducing the parishioners to give up the manor-house for a
parsonage-house&mdash;which appears to have been the scheme of
the sellers, and some of the purchasers,&mdash;was not entirely
abandoned till 1825; but it was never consented to by the
vestry.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the present minister was obliged to be
non-resident, for a considerable time, because he could find no
house in the parish to live in.&nbsp; He was anxious to be
amongst those whose souls had been given to his charge; and in
September, 1820, we find he offers to give &pound;200 out of his
own pocket, towards purchasing the manor-house, and promises to
endeavour to obtain a loan from Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty Fund
for the rest of the sum, if the parish will but sell the
house.&nbsp; Even a large subscription-list was got up to
purchase it.&nbsp; The inhabitants, however, will not now give
their consent even to a sale of the property.&nbsp; Having
witnessed what the bishop and his lessees got by purchasing the
waste, &ldquo;in the Lanes and Road Ways dispersed in, about, and
within the said Parish of Paddington;&rdquo; perhaps the
inhabitants fancied that, by having purchased the very kernel of
this estate, they might have also become possessed of some of
those tegumentary portions of which their predecessors had been
so considerately relieved.&nbsp; But nothing daunted by their
refusal, either to give, or sell, and thoroughly knowing their
own powers, the managers of the parish bring this question again
before a meeting of vestry, held the following month, and the
Chairman then declares it to be carried; but on a poll being
demanded, and taken, the motion was found to have been lost.</p>
<p>This degree of independence did not at all satisfy the now
losing party.&nbsp; That the parishioners should begin to be
awake to their own power, was a thing not to be endured, and a
local Act was devised for them, into which trap they fell.&nbsp;
In this <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Act, four rambling clauses are inserted as to what may,
and what may not, be done with the manor-house.&nbsp; And it may,
if a special meeting of the vestry shall think fit, &ldquo;be
thenceforth for ever held and used as and for the parsonage-house
and glebe-lands of the said parish, or as a residence for the
perpetual curate of the said parish and his
successors.&rdquo;&nbsp; So impressed, however, were those
vestrymen who had been so recently elected under the detestable
principles of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act, with their duty to
their fellow-parishioners; and with the necessity there was not
to outrage the general feeling thus publicly expressed, that no
sanction to part with their purchase could be obtained even from
them.&nbsp; But the old manor-house, which had been let by the
parish to a lady, who for some time kept a boarding-school there,
was doomed to destruction.&nbsp; Occupation did not lay the
spectres who had claimed this dwelling for their own.&nbsp; It
was pulled down; the materials were sold, and the ground on which
it stood, with that portion of its pleasure-ground which
remained, was consecrated on the tenth of August, 1825, for the
purpose of further increasing the size of the church-yard.</p>
<p>As all, rich and poor, young and old, were now crying shame on
the spiritual governors of the parish, for not finding their
deputy with a suitable residence, the bishops&rsquo; building Act
of 1825,&mdash;acknowledging the scandal, in these words,
&ldquo;and as the present curate of Paddington has not any house
attached to his curacy&rdquo;&mdash;finds out &ldquo;that it
would be proper that the said Lord Bishop of London, &amp;c.,
should be at liberty to set apart, appropriate, and to settle in
free alms, part of the demised property, as the site for a
residence, &amp;c.;&rdquo; and by the seventeenth clause of the
sixth George IV., cap. 45, it is enacted, that the said William,
Bishop of London, &amp;c., within five years from the passing of
this Act, by indenture, &ldquo;enrolled in the High Court of
Chancery,&rdquo; should grant to Charles Theomartyr Crane, or his
successors, any quantity of the Paddington estate, &ldquo;not
exceeding one acre,&rdquo; to hold for himself and his successors
for ever in free alms, and that he, the said curate, shall be
&ldquo;a body corporate for the purpose;&rdquo; and that he may
&ldquo;receive, take and hold such ground with any messuages and
buildings thereon, notwithstanding any of the laws against
Mortmain, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after this an acre of ground, <i>a small portion of</i>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Parsons Field</span>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142"
class="citation">[142]</a> was granted and settled on the curate
for the purpose named.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>By a
return granted by order of the House of Commons, twenty-first of
March, 1848, of all monies borrowed from the trustees of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s Bounty, and not re-paid, I find that on the eleventh
of October, 1830, St. Mary&rsquo;s Paddington curacy, borrowed
&pound;1,820.&nbsp; That &pound;1,243 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, had
been repaid, as principal, and &pound;693 3<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>,
as interest.&nbsp; This sum, and upwards, I presume, was spent on
this acre of freehold ground.&nbsp; A comfortable looking
residence, not six stories high, was built; and for many years
used as &ldquo;the parsonage-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is no longer,
however, the parsonage; having been sold with the land belonging
to it, soon after St. Mary&rsquo;s ceased to be the parish
church.&nbsp; This bargain was secured, as I am informed, by the
district surveyor for &pound;3,525; I have also heard there was
some difficulty about effecting this sale; and that it was at
last managed through the agency of the church-commissioners, who
out of the purchase-money paid upwards of &pound;80 towards the
expenses of the sale.&nbsp; The greater portion of the balance
being applied, according to the benevolent wish of the present
minister of the parish, in the purchase of <i>two</i>
parsonage-houses; one for the new parish church, No. 13,
Sussex-gardens, on the north side of St. James&rsquo;s; the other
for the old church&mdash;No. 1, St. Mary&rsquo;s-terrace, the
first of a row of eleven houses, built on a strip of the former
parsonage pleasure-grounds.</p>
<h4>Bayswater Chapel.</h4>
<p>Down to 1818, Saint Mary&rsquo;s was the only place of
worship, in connection with the State-Religion, for the whole of
the parish of Paddington.</p>
<p>So destitute of religious instruction and places of worship
were the suburbs of London, and many other populous places at
this time, that the State itself could no longer remain blind to
the need.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gracious recommendation&rdquo; came from
the throne to the Parliament, and the people; and the
fifty-eighth Geo. III., cap. 45&mdash;&ldquo;An Act for building
and promoting the building of additional churches in populous
parishes&rdquo;&mdash;became a law on the thirtieth May,
1818.&nbsp; We are told by Mr. Faulkner, in his History of
Kensington, that Mr. Edward Orme, of Bayswater, was the first
private individual who built a chapel, after His Majesty had
pointed out this want of church accommodation; Bayswater chapel,
in St. Petersburg place, being built at his expense.</p>
<p>This chapel is, as Mr. Faulkner observes, a plain building;
but &ldquo;possesses some advantages over many modern built
places of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>The
stained glass window of which Mr. Faulkner speaks, has been
removed from this church; and the present pulpit would not, I
imagine, be considered of the fourteenth century, to which period
Mr. Faulkner attributed the one existing, when the History of
Kensington was written.</p>
<p>This chapel, which is &ldquo;capable of holding twelve hundred
persons, was opened on the fifteenth of November, 1818, by the
Rev. Dr. Busfield,&rdquo; the first appointed minister.&nbsp; And
from that day to the present, it has not cost the parish of
Paddington one shilling for its support: a fact so impressive,
that no comment or commendation is required.&nbsp; Badly enough
must those who wished to see a state-religion preserved, have
thought this chapel needed; for, from the returns made in
compliance with directions given to the commissioners appointed
by the above-named Act, we find that, at this time, in the
parishes of Kensington and Paddington, &ldquo;there are no less
than twelve thousand persons more, than could be accommodated in
the several places of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Connaught Chapel&mdash;now St. John&rsquo;s.</h4>
<p>For a single proprietor of the soil to have built one chapel
which would hold a tenth part of this unaccommodated population,
was something; but this could not satisfy the conscience of the
good curate of Paddington, who saw the population of his parish
every day increasing.</p>
<p>From 1811, to 1821, the average rate of increase was two
hundred souls, per annum; from 1821, to 1831, eight hundred; and
although, early in March, 1826, Dr. Crane applied to the Church
Commissioners for assistance, it was not till July, 1839, that
the plan for Connaught Chapel was finally approved by them.&nbsp;
There was no bishop, no lessees, who could see their
curate&rsquo;s distress, and who would come forward with the
remedy.&nbsp; The want of the necessary funds to carry out the
design; and the death of Mr. Cockerill, the bishop&rsquo;s
surveyor, and the architect originally employed; seem to have
been the other chief causes of the delay.&nbsp; For immediately
after the first application to the commissioners, we find that
they &ldquo;think a chapel capable of holding fifteen hundred
persons, <i>with seven hundred free sittings</i> should be
built;&rdquo; and they offer, from the funds entrusted to them by
Parliament, &pound;5,500 to accomplish this object.&nbsp;
Communication and correspondence take place respecting this
offer; and, within a week, the proposed grant is increased to
&pound;6,000, <i>with the assurance that one </i><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span><i>third of
the number the chapel will hold will suffice for the number of
free sittings</i>.</p>
<p>This was in March, 1826.&nbsp; By July, 1829, the voluntary
subscriptions, amounted to &pound;2,400; <a
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a> which sum, with &pound;59 18<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, was placed in the banker&rsquo;s hands, in order that
the building might be begun.&nbsp; Mr. Cockerill&rsquo;s first
plan would have cost &pound;11,020; this he was obliged to modify
from the circumstance of sufficient funds not being
forthcoming.&nbsp; &pound;8,000 was the amount of his next
estimate, but this plan he did not live to carry out; and with
its execution his son, the present Royal Acadamician, was not
entrusted.&nbsp; To Mr. Fowler, we owe the design for the present
building; his final estimate for which was &pound;8,592
5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>
<p>Several ineffectual attempts have been made at different
times, since this church was finished, to induce the vestry to
grant funds for its enlargement.&nbsp; But in July, 1848, when
the church-rate was in full play, the demand could no longer be
resisted; and on the fourth of that month, it was resolved by the
vestry, unanimously, that the west gallery of St. John&rsquo;s be
enlarged, but at a cost not to exceed &pound;700.&nbsp; The
enlargement was effected, and, so far as my knowledge goes, this
is the only resolution of the vestry, respecting the expenditure
of money for church-purposes, that has ever been observed.</p>
<p>This church, however, even in its brief existence, has been
some expense to others, besides those who have been accommodated
by it.&nbsp; Down to 1839, the minister received the stipend
appointed him by the Church Commissioners; the surplus pew-rents
being paid to the churchwardens towards the expenses of the
church.&nbsp; Since that date no pew-rents have been paid to the
churchwardens of the parish, but they have had to pay out of the
parish funds upwards of &pound;4,800, including the sum
above-mentioned.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s is not a copy of any particular period of
middle-age art, being built in the style designated
pseudo-gothic.&nbsp; But it <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>is not necessary to give any
particular description of this building; for I saw by a model of
it, which was honoured with an excellent place amidst the
multitudinous and never to be forgotten beauties of the Great
Exhibition, that Mr. Fowler&rsquo;s original design was not
completely carried out.&nbsp; Its exterior, as finished, presents
to us nothing offensive; and the interior is well proportioned,
well arranged, and, with the exception of the painted window at
the eastern end, contains nothing incompatible with a religious
feeling.</p>
<p>Although every one who wishes to receive instruction from the
visible remnants of the past, must admire the works of art as
preserved to us in the brilliant colours, and quaint symbolic
designs, which modify &ldquo;God&rsquo;s light&rdquo; as it
attempts to enter into the ancient temples dedicated to his
service; and although every one who can so feel, must detest the
barbarity of a Barebones&mdash;who is said to have thanked God
every time his zealous and mischievous weapon was raised from the
demolition of the Canterbury windows&mdash;yet I think it would
be difficult to find any satisfactory reason for the
re-introduction of stained glass pictures, and tinted glass, into
the church windows of our day.&nbsp; Every reason I have ever
heard in favour of &ldquo;the dim religious light,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the scriptural story,&rdquo; is equally powerful in favour
of all other modes of teaching by &ldquo;stealing the
senses.&rdquo;&nbsp; If painted glass, why not painted
canvass?&nbsp; If one picture, why not a hundred?&nbsp; If
candles on the altar, why not lighted?&nbsp; If Puseyism, why not
full-blown Romanism?&nbsp; But this is only one of the many
&ldquo;first step to Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as in the case of St.
John&rsquo;s window, which was the origin of this remark, these
first steps are not completed at once.&nbsp; How long it took to
fill up the whole east window of St. John&rsquo;s I do not
remember; but there were only a few Apostles there at one time;
and the &ldquo;naughty boy&rdquo;&mdash;who went to this church,
more I fear to look at this window than to say his prayers, or
hear the very excellent and learned ministers who preach
there&mdash;asked his Ma, one day, &ldquo;why they did not write
down the names of <i>those men</i>, so that he could find out who
they were?&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was told they were the Twelve
Apostles&mdash;he said &ldquo;Oh no, that can&rsquo;t be, there
are but ten, for I count them every Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The New Parish Church&mdash;St. James&rsquo;s.</h4>
<p>Twenty years ago, the bishop&rsquo;s building Acts were
beginning to tell in real earnest; and from 1831 to 1841, the
increase in the population of the parish of Paddington, averaged
<i>above </i><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span><i>one thousand per annum</i>.&nbsp; Yet the errors of
the past were unnoticed by those who never wish to see errors in
high places; for it was not till the fifth of December, 1837,
that the local governors of Paddington saw the necessity, created
by this annual addition of a thousand souls to the parish, for
increased means of religious instruction, and public worship; and
then their attention to this necessity was aroused by their
Reverend Chairman, who, on that day, stated he was desired by the
Bishop of London to call the attention of the vestry to the great
want of additional church room there was in the parish&mdash;or
more correctly speaking <i>on his estate</i>.&nbsp; The bishop
sent word &ldquo;that he and the trustees had resolved upon a
site for a new church; and that he would submit the case, (of the
destitution of this parish), to the Metropolitan Church
Committee; and would himself subscribe &pound;300!&rdquo; <a
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a></p>
<p>The vestry, in obedience to this message, resolved &ldquo;that
an additional church would be highly beneficial to the parish at
large;&rdquo; and a committee, with full powers to carry out this
resolution was at once appointed.&nbsp; Expressions of praise
escaped some lips; and the vestry did not break up, as their
minutes shew, without thanking the bishop for the plot of ground
on which the new church was to be built, and the liberal
subscription offered by him.&nbsp; Whether any one in the vestry
remembered the words of the polished nobleman, who said,
&ldquo;Praise, when it is not deserved, is the severest satire
and abuse,&rdquo; I do not know; I am inclined to believe that
the majority of those who tendered their thanks to the bishop,
were sincere.&nbsp; But how oddly do those praises and thanks
come upon the reader, who has studied the history of the
Paddington Estate!</p>
<p>This new Paddington church was to be built by subscription on
a site fixed by the owners of the Estate, at the western
extremity of the Grand Junction-road.&nbsp; And on the eighth of
June, 1840, the committee report &ldquo;that a design adapted to
the wants and means of the parish has been selected by the
vestry,&rdquo; subject to the appropriation of the two great
subscribers; &ldquo;the Metropolitan Churches Committee,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Commissioners for building new
churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Plans
were advertised for, and thirty-eight designs were
received.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five of the most eligible&rdquo; were
selected; and the one with the motto, &ldquo;Let merit bear the
Palm,&rdquo; was especially recommended by the Committee to the
vestry.&nbsp; On this, as on many another occasion, however,
<i>merit</i> was jostled out of the field by mediocrity, or
something worse, and Mr. Lindsey&rsquo;s design was rejected on
account of his having been induced to increase the detailed cost
of the building far beyond his original estimate.</p>
<p>The structure, as it now stands, is said to be the result of
the combined genius of Messrs. Gutch and Goldicutt; and we are
further told that this precious specimen of &ldquo;Brummagem
Gothic,&rdquo; was originally designed for a Grecian building,
but was altered to suit the &ldquo;taste of the
times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Vulliamy, one of the gentlemen who had
responded to the advertisement, felt his talent to be so
scandalized by the acceptance of this clumsy design, that he
printed a letter, which he addressed to the vestry; in which he
points out that the successful candidate is very improperly, as
he thinks, an influential member of that board.&nbsp; This
gentleman, was the bishop&rsquo;s surveyor, and the
district-surveyor&mdash;two offices totally incompatible.&nbsp;
But who could be supposed to know better the tastes and wants of
the people of Paddington?&nbsp; So little did he know, however,
that his second, or amended design, was found to be so
obtrusively ugly that those who had adopted it could not see it
carried out; and, although the original estimate for this design
was fixed at &pound;8,600, another thousand was readily added, in
order that the deformity, which had been so unanimously fixed on,
might be again amended!</p>
<p>This church in all its present taste, the vestry agreed should
become the parish church; but it was not till March, 1845, that
the Reverend Chairman reported to the vestry that the Church
Commissioners had executed the deed to transfer the rights,
&amp;c., from St. Mary&rsquo;s to St. James&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A distinct understanding was come to at this time that the old
church should be enlarged.&nbsp; And &ldquo;by these
means,&rdquo; says the report of 1840, &ldquo;accommodation will
be provided for four thousand persons, or including Bayswater
chapel, which may hereafter be made a parochial chapel, for more
than five thousand persons, in a parish supposed to contain
twenty thousand souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report goes on to state
that each of the four districts, into which the parish will be
divided, &ldquo;will be placed under the immediate care of its
respective minister or ministers; and these important results
will have been obtained <i>without any compulsory levy on the
parishioners</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Besides a miscalculation of at least four thousand in
the then actual population of Paddington, these reporters must
have been very ignorant of the previous history of the parish, or
they must have had very bad memories.&nbsp; We have seen how St.
Mary&rsquo;s was built, and how it was paid for; and a
church-rate enforced by warrants of distress, and these again
backed up by the certainty of imprisonment, till the rate and all
expenses were paid, I think one may call a compulsory levy.&nbsp;
Even those who lived in the parish the year before this report
was written, had felt the twitch of this clerical
scourge,&mdash;not the last they were to feel by a great number;
for on the twenty-fourth of April, 1839, a church-rate was made,
and the Cash Accounts for the year ending, April, 1838&ndash;39,
shew that &pound;850 5<i>s.</i> 9&frac34;<i>d.</i> had been
collected by &ldquo;compulsory levy,&rdquo; in these years,
&ldquo;to pay off Mrs. Jenks&rsquo;s last Church Bond
Debt.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how these reporters could have forgotten
the day ever memorable in the annals of the present vestry of
Paddington, I cannot imagine; nor how that on this fifth day of
May, 1829, when the church-rate was in danger, the Bishop of
London, the Viscount Bernard, the Honourable Mr.
Mac&rsquo;Donald, the Rev. John Joseph Pike, and nine
others,&mdash;having taken the oath of office, to execute
faithfully, impartially, and honestly, according to the best of
their skill and knowledge, the several powers and authorities
reposed in them&mdash;proceeded at once, with other vestrymen, to
make a church-rate of threepence in the pound; for so far as I
can discover, this is the only time the vestry of Paddington was
ever honoured, at its sittings, by a visit from the spiritual and
temporal lord of the parish.</p>
<p>This congratulation of the Committee, respecting all the good
that had been done without any compulsory levy, was only the
warming up, under more favourable circumstances for the instant,
of one that had been tendered to the parish, when the first
subscriptions for St. John&rsquo;s were announced.&nbsp; But for
that half year, 1826, sixpence in the pound was the amount of the
church-rate levied, the full sum allowed by the law.&nbsp; And,
although there was no compulsory levy at the time this report was
written&mdash;none from 1839 to 1842,&mdash;yet there was one
made in the latter year, which continued to be made twice-a-year,
down to 1851, continues to be made annually now, and must be
continued for years to come.</p>
<p>On the eighth of February, 1843, &ldquo;the Committee for
building the new church in this parish, have the satisfaction of
informing the parishioners, that the church is nearly completed,
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and will
be opened for Divine service, on or before the first of May next,
<i>provided sufficient funds for that purpose are previously
collected</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, &ldquo;the immediate aid of those
persons who have not subscribed to this important
undertaking&rdquo; is solicited, &ldquo;to defray the whole
expense, for which a considerable sum is still
required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even St. James&rsquo;s was not finished without a
&ldquo;compulsory levy;&rdquo; for on the thirtieth of June,
1843, the committee report that after paying &pound;10,000, other
expenses had been incurred, and were about to be incurred, which
they hoped to raise by subscription.&nbsp; No further
subscriptions were forthcoming, however; and in August, 1844, the
committee state to the vestry that &pound;950 is still due; that
the clock and organ were not subscribed for, as anticipated; and
that there are other additional works estimated at &pound;300
more; all of which they beg to transfer to the especial care of
the ratepayers.&nbsp; These, as well as other sums, were paid out
of the church-rate by order of the vestry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The churchwardens&rsquo; account for the year
1843&ndash;44&rdquo; shews the &ldquo;total expenditure for Saint
James&rsquo;s church, for the year ending April, 1844, to have,
been &pound;2,190 12<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, the whole of which,
with the exception of &pound;200, &ldquo;the first annual payment
from the pew-rents,&rdquo; was paid by the Churchwardens out of
the parish funds.&nbsp; This, however, was not all the
Churchwardens paid towards St. James&rsquo;s; for in &ldquo;the
church-rate account&rdquo; for the ensuing year, the following
item occurs, &ldquo;January thirtieth, 1845, Paid Mr. Bishop, for
organ at St. James&rsquo;s Church, &pound;497 12<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; There are other items, too,&mdash;balance
of architect&rsquo;s commission, church plate, and
printing&mdash;which bring the sum paid this year up to
&pound;753 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, over and above the ordinary
disbursements, which are this year &pound;100 more than the
pew-rents paid to the churchwardens.&nbsp; Neither was this
church, which <i>was to have been built without</i>
&ldquo;<i>compulsory levy</i>,&rdquo; paid for yet; for in the
next year&rsquo;s account, we find a &ldquo;Cross Wall&rdquo; in
the vaults paid for; roofing over the vestry room, at St.
James&rsquo;s church; building new porches to the lobby
entrances; and the &ldquo;Turret clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; These four
items amounted to &pound;662 19<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, the ordinary
expenses being increased by &pound;246 14<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>,
above the receipts, for other church fittings.&nbsp; And on the
twenty-fourth of December, 1847, there is another &pound;100 paid
for re-glazing the windows with ground-glass; so that before St.
James&rsquo;s was fairly done with, it had cost the rate-payers
over and above all subscriptions, &pound;3,850 at the
least&mdash;to say <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>nothing of interest of money borrowed, at a very high
rate, to pay these sums. <a name="citation151a"></a><a
href="#footnote151a" class="citation">[151a]</a></p>
<h4>Trinity.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Double Trinity,&rdquo; as I once heard it
called by the showman, who pointed with his wand to the young
lady with two triangles on her breast, who is perched with that
ornament, or symbol, in full view of all who enter by the south
door; her duplicate being in the same position over the northern
entrance.&nbsp; But for this notification, this church might be
taken to belong to saints of the masculine gender; the western
door being decorated by a gentleman on either side; one with the
cross-keys, the other with the cross-swords.&nbsp; But these
Guardian Saints are not the only images set up for our love or
hatred; confidence or fear; instruction or bamboozlement; on the
walls of this church, or they would not be noticed here.&nbsp;
Trinity, &ldquo;the pet church of Paddington,&rdquo; the church
on which church-goers pride themselves as something that is
worthy of this great and important parish, is in fact, garnished
all over with images, or symbols, and may be considered a
creditable mimick of antiquated masonry on a small scale.&nbsp;
On this building, both architect and mason appear to have
exhausted all the skill of their craft, to produce an edifice,
which shall transport the sense of sight, if not the mind it
influences, to those glorious middle ages, for the revival of
which some few enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen of the
nineteenth century are working so desperately.&nbsp; To be
obliged to work with the materials of the nineteenth, must be a
sad drawback on their enthusiasm.&nbsp; These <i>artists</i>
devise all kind of means to give the charm of antiquity to their
works, it is true; but there is an air of newness about Trinity,
and such like buildings, which is any thing but pleasing, and
which ill assorts with any notion of veneration.&nbsp; Some
centuries hence, if Trinity does not share the fate of the
Sheldon church, children may look on it with something like awe;
and grown-up persons with pity for that generation, whose
genius&mdash;able to make the lightning-force subservient to its
will <a name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a>&mdash;able to contrive machines to
carry the material form to which that genius is linked, sixty
miles an hour with certainty and safety&mdash;able to raise
structures which surpass in size and beauty, anything the genius
of man ever before created, was <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>yet unable to erect a house in which
to worship its God, except in mimickry of forms suitable to the
intelligence of past and darker ages. <a
name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a"
class="citation">[152a]</a></p>
<p>At a distance, in Trinity, we see fair proportions and
elegance of form, pleasing to the eye of all who admire the
architectural art; on closer inspection, nuns and monks, and
bishops, and kings, and monsters with faces which disgrace
humanity; and beasts so detestably ugly, or so ridiculously
grotesque, that young and old are arrested in their progress, and
compelled to ask the meaning of it all.&nbsp; I have asked many
persons, but none of them, being either masons or priests, could
tell.&nbsp; This, however, every sensible man is beginning to
tell to his neighbour, and pretty plainly too, that no priest or
mason shall drag him back to the decorations and deformities of
the fourteenth century, of which Trinity is a sufficient
example.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Holy Blessed Trinity&rdquo; is not
understood when it is surrounded by an unintelligible mass of
deformity; and that which has no meaning for the people, must be
as repulsive in a material structure, as it is in a Divine
Thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freemasons of the Church&rdquo; do tell us, what those
who are not freemasons, can easily imagine, viz., that many of
the grotesque and disgusting gothic carvings, which still exist
in and around the ancient churches, were placed there by monks,
or monkish masons, as caricatures of their secular brethren, and
others, who had offended them.&nbsp; Now, if the monsters with
heads as large as life, who grin and gape with horrible
contortions from the six pinnacles on each side of this church,
are intended to be the monumental effigies of twelve of the
preceding owners of the Paddington Estate, (those who have most
grossly mismanaged and abused it,) let us be told so; and then I
have no doubt some of the people of Paddington would enjoy the
joke, as much as any Grand Master of the masonic craft; but it is
really too bad to stick up unintelligible symbols, on and about
that which is called a religious temple, and leave all the
uninitiated to guess at their meaning.&nbsp; The days for such
unenlightened and selfish craft are numbered; and the splitting
of the foundation walls of Trinity, may be looked upon as an
emblem of their fulfilment. <a name="citation152b"></a><a
href="#footnote152b" class="citation">[152b]</a>&nbsp; <i>The
people must be taught</i>; and that, too, without <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>any
previous oath-taking.&nbsp; Colleges, and crafts, if they are
worth preserving, will endure without the pledges given to
secrecy; if they are not, no preliminary swearing will enable
them to maintain their ancient ascendancy.&nbsp; Priests and
masons may fancy they still rule the world; and it may be that
they do; but however much they may wish it, their reign will not
be long, even if it is not now virtually ended.&nbsp; A third
element has been admitted to power.&nbsp; People are teaching
themselves the essentials of all government, and they must
ultimately rule.&nbsp; Observers have long since discovered, that
unfettered genius has done more for the world, than the most
renowned systems; and they are no longer willing to assist in
upholding those educational establishments, whose very
foundations are laid in secrecy, cliquedom, and dogmata.&nbsp; To
know what kingcraft can do for us, we may consult the history of
our own James&rsquo;s and Charles&rsquo;s; to know what
priestcraft has done for the world, we have only to read William
Hewitt&rsquo;s Popular History of it; and to prove what the
masonic craft has not attempted to do, we have only to take a
walk into &ldquo;Milton&rsquo;s Golden Lane,&rdquo; <a
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a> or any other of the many wretched
lanes and alleys of this or any other large city.&nbsp; There is,
however, an Immaterial Essence in this world of ours which no
craft or cunning <i>can</i> &ldquo;put down;&rdquo; and,
fortunately for the world, it is not <i>entirely</i> in the
keeping of any craft.</p>
<p>The prelate who consecrated Trinity, is known to have been
indulgent towards practices in the church, which had long since
ceased to be observed.&nbsp; Reformation of some kind was found
to be necessary, and practices distasteful to reformers, were
introduced.&nbsp; None of those objectionable practices, however,
were ever witnessed <i>within</i> any of the churches in
Paddington; and this I look upon as an additional reason for
inducing the people to ask the bishop, their appointed governor,
to condescend to give them some satisfactory reason for the
erection of these &ldquo;ornaments,&rdquo; which he has
consecrated, and for which they have to pay.&nbsp; There is
another course open to the bishop, which scarcely any one, with
the exception of the architect, would be grieved by his
adopting.</p>
<p>But to erect this structure, fitted, to all external
appearance, only for the performance of the gorgeous histrionical
ceremonies of the most depraved period of the Roman or Anglican
churches, the people of Paddington have been, and still are,
obliged to subscribe by &ldquo;compulsory levy;&rdquo; and having
been thus made instrumental, willing or unwilling, in assisting
to <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>resuscitate the dry bones of a monster belonging to a
former period, they were then asked, (like other people similarly
situated) by their local governors, to assist them in laying the
spectre that such follies as these had again presented to the
mind of the English public.</p>
<p>And how; and at what cost was Trinity built?</p>
<p>In 1843, on the fourth of July, the Rev. Chairman of the
vestry, informed that body, he had received a communication from
the Rev. Mr. Miles, expressing his readiness to contribute
&pound;4000 towards the erection of an additional church in
Paddington, upon a site already granted by the bishop and his
lessees.</p>
<p>This, the third site, provided out of the four acres to be
granted, according to the bishop&rsquo;s last building Act, was a
<i>deep hole</i>, which had been left at the point of junction of
the Bishop&rsquo;s-road with the Westbourn-terrace road; these
roads having been raised by the Great Western Railway Company,
according to agreement with the owners of the estate, when the
railway bridges were built.&nbsp; So deep was this hole, and so
unfitted was it for the site of a church, that the parishioners
would have been money in pocket, if the vestry had politely
thanked the bishop and his lessees for their kindness in granting
it, and bought the land somewhere else.&nbsp; But then that would
not have done for the bishop and his lessees.&nbsp; They knew,
and the builders who took their land knew, the increased value a
church would give to the neighbouring ground; and, as it had been
planned that the church would be better here than elsewhere, here
it must be, or no where; although the foundations did cost the
parishioners above &pound;2,000; and although another thousand
&ldquo;would not have been lavishly thrown away, <i>had the
proper authorities been sufficiently liberal in granting
it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the tenth of July, at an adjourned meeting of the vestry, a
committee was appointed to take Mr. Miles&rsquo;s letter into
consideration, to confer with the bishop, and to report to the
vestry thereon.&nbsp; The only other important business done at
this meeting, was, to agree to borrow &pound;2,000, on the
security of the church-rates, instead of &pound;1,700, as had
been previously proposed.&nbsp; This was to be raised to pay the
debts of St. James&rsquo;s, and the other churches.&nbsp; On the
twelfth of June, the Vestry had pledged themselves to raise
&pound;2,000 towards increased church-accommodation, if the
church commissioners would but pay the &pound;2,000 they had
promised.&nbsp; On the eleventh of December, in the same <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>year, after
receiving the report of their committee, the vestry agree to
increase this sum to &pound;6,000; &ldquo;which they presume will
be sufficient for the erection of a suitable church, with Mr.
Miles&rsquo;s donation, and such other sums as may be raised by
subscription, and obtained from the church
commissioners.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the second of January, 1844, a
committee was appointed, with full powers, to build the new
church.</p>
<p>On the sixth of February, 1844, a letter was read from the
church commissioners, consenting to make a grant of &pound;1,000
towards the proposed new church; upon certain conditions therein
mentioned.</p>
<p>On the fourth of March, the new church committee report
&ldquo;that they find from the specification of the architect,
that the expenses of constructing the foundation, on the site
allotted to the church, will be so great as to prevent the
possibility of erecting a suitable edifice thereon for the sum at
the disposal of the committee; and they therefore recommend that
&pound;2,500 <i>more</i> be borrowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the ninth
of March, it was resolved, that this further sum should be
raised; and on the fifteenth of January, 1846, it was resolved,
unanimously, by the Vestry, &ldquo;That a sum of &pound;13,000
should be raised under the provisions of the church building
Acts, <i>on the credit of the church-rate</i>, <i>for the
erection of Trinity Church</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make assurance doubly sure, this sum was again voted
towards the cost of building Trinity, on the twenty-sixth of
March, 1846; and by the final report and statement of the
committee appointed to build this church, dated twenty-ninth of
March, 1847, we find the total cost of this building to have been
&pound;18,458 11<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; and says that
report&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The church accommodates 1,582 persons; 982
in pews; 600 in free sittings.</p>
<p>The Lord Bishop of London presented the font.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Miles, the incumbent, presented the large
stained glass window, and the encaustic tiles in the chancel.</p>
<p>Henry Morris Kemshead, Esq. presented one of the stained glass
windows in the chancel; the other three were by subscriptions
from various persons.</p>
<p>George Gutch, Esq. presented the dial, fixed in the gallery
under the organ.</p>
<p>Thomas Cundy, Esq., the architect, presented the carved stone
altar piece.&rdquo; <a name="citation155"></a><a
href="#footnote155" class="citation">[155]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>A
substantial parsonage-house, built at the north-west corner of
the piece of ground surrounding this church, is occupied by the
minister, the Rev. Mr. Miles, who is said to have given, in
addition to his other donations, &pound;500 towards its
erection.</p>
<p>The extreme liberality in the contributions of the present
incumbent of this church must be properly appreciated, even by
those who do not admire being charged with church-rates to make
up a sufficient sum to build a place of worship, into which they
are never likely to enter; and the greater part of the income
from which has been previously secured on the minister, as a good
investment for the capital he may have advanced&mdash;a plan of
&ldquo;getting up a church&rdquo; now very much in fashion.</p>
<h4>All Saints.</h4>
<p>From 1841 to 1851, the population of Paddington increased on
the average, <i>above two thousand one hundred per annum</i>; and
the bishop&rsquo;s rents increased in due proportion; but as the
newcomers were almost all strangers to the parish, they had
never, perhaps, heard one word of the History of the Paddington
Estate.&nbsp; On this ignorance the owners of that estate must
have relied, when they determined to saddle the rate-payers of
Paddington with the expense of building and furnishing their
churches, and with every other charge incidental to that
Estate.&nbsp; But to enable the owners to carry out their
project, the consent of the vestry of the parish must be first
had and obtained; and to give this consent the vestry were not
unwilling; for on the very day they voted away &pound;13,000 for
Trinity, they also bound themselves to raise, by rates and
subscription, <i>or by rates alone</i>, &pound;6,000 more for
another church. <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a></p>
<p>The site for this church&mdash;a portion of the old
reservoir,&mdash;had already been given up by the Grand Junction
Waterworks Company, to the bishop and his lessees, as agreed
upon, and enacted, by the 7th and 8th Vic. cap. 30.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of January, 1846, the vestry resolved,
&ldquo;that <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>it is expedient to build a church in Cambridge-place;
and that a committee be appointed to consider the subject in all
its bearings, and report thereon to the vestry.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
committee recommended that &pound;4,000 should be raised by a
loan on the church-rates towards the cost of this new building,
the furniture, and fittings; that it hold 1,500 persons; and that
the cost of the building should be limited to &pound;6,000;
&pound;2,000 of which, they recommend, should be raised by
subscription; but they recommend the works to be begun, when the
subscriptions amount to &pound;1,500; but not before.&nbsp; Their
report was adopted by the vestry; it was at once resolved that
the &pound;4000 should be raised; that their old friends, the
church commissioners, should be applied to for assistance; and
that the vestry-clerk should write to the bishop of London,
apprizing him of the day&rsquo;s proceedings; requesting, at the
same time, that directions may be given to have the site of the
church conveyed in the usual manner.</p>
<p>All this was to be carried into effect by the Trinity Church
Committee.</p>
<p>On the third of March, a letter was read from the Church
Commissioners, expressing regret that the state of their funds
and urgent claims from various other quarters, would not permit
them to make any grant of money, this time, towards the proposed
new church; but as no more of these public funds could be
obtained, the bishop sends word he will give &pound;500.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth of March, a special meeting of the vestry
is held, to pass unanimously, three resolutions, to enable the
vestrymen to charge the rates with &pound;19,000, for building
Trinity and this church; they appeal again to the Church
Commissioners for <i>a nominal grant</i> &ldquo;<i>to establish
the validity of their proceedings</i>;&rdquo; and, considering
the good and pious object, for which the application is made, the
commissioners relent, and grant <i>one hundred pounds</i>.&nbsp;
After much difficulty &pound;19,000, is at length borrowed.&nbsp;
But one Assurance Office, of high respectability, refused to have
anything to do with this loan, even after the lawyers had put the
parish to the expense of &pound;32 17<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> on
account of it; &pound;103 3<i>s.</i> being the amount of two
other bills &ldquo;for negotiating&rdquo; this loan. <a
name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a></p>
<p>But this sum was not enough to carry on the church account;
another &pound;1000 had to be borrowed of the banker, on the
fourteenth of December, 1847; and above &pound;100 interest was
paid on that sum before the loan was returned.&nbsp; Some time
after this, the committee report that the subscriptions for All
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Saint&rsquo;s Church amount to &pound;1,635 2<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i>; and that the cost of the building has been
&pound;7,434 18<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>
<p>This church is built in the early pointed style, and its
internal fittings and decorations are exceedingly plain.&nbsp; It
is capable of holding 1,500 persons; 600 free seats, and 900
appropriated, or pew sittings.</p>
<p>The amount of church-rate, <i>collected</i> for nine years,
ending April, 1852, was &pound;20,574 3<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
Of this there was &ldquo;balance in hand of &pound;1,607
15<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>;&rdquo; but a debt of &pound;14,500 was
owing for churches which had been built.&nbsp; This debt is
bearing interest at the rate of four-and-a-half per cent; and
&pound;900 is paid off annually.&nbsp; So that these four
churches will have cost the rate-payers of Paddington upwards of
&pound;40,000, over and above all the sums given by the Church
Commissioners, Metropolitan Committee, bishop and lessees, all
Parliamentary provision of the sites, and all private
subscriptions; and this sum of money, with upwards of
&pound;10,000 paid for St Mary&rsquo;s, and the church-yard, will
have been raised by &ldquo;<i>compulsory levy</i>,&rdquo; from
rate-payers of all denominations; while the receipts of
&ldquo;the rectorial and other lands&rdquo; are quietly pocketed
by the rector and his lessees!</p>
<p>But I have heard rate-payers told, as a great consolation,
&ldquo;that the churches of Paddington cost nothing in comparison
to the churches of Marylebone.&rdquo;&nbsp; This however, may not
be very consoling to those who know the cost of the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wesleyan Metropolitan Chapels, which have been
recently built.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But the actual cost of the churches of Paddington, is not the
whole of the evil, though, considering all the circumstances,
this is sufficiently oppressive.&nbsp; These churches, after all,
are not free: pew-rents are obliged to be taken for the support
of the ministers; the poor parishioners have less than one-third
of the room allotted to them, and a considerable portion of this
space is reserved for the best singers, and most showy scholars
of the church schools.</p>
<p>And after all this; after all the money raised &ldquo;by
compulsory levy&rdquo; to build, furnish, ornament and decorate;
and after all the pew-rents are paid; these churches do not pay
their own ordinary expenses.&nbsp; No; not after there is added
to this income the portion of the burial-fees received by the
churchwardens; but this source of income, which has averaged for
many years more than &pound;350 per annum, must soon cease.&nbsp;
So that dissenters and others, who reside even on a
bishop&rsquo;s estate, have a fair prospect of being called on to
pay a church-rate, after all the churches which the rate-payers
have built, shall have been paid for.</p>
<p>Towards defraying these ordinary expenses of the churches, the
ministers of Trinity, and All Saints, contribute fifteen per
cent. of the pew-rents received by them; the minister of St.
James&rsquo;s &pound;200 per annum, the stipend set aside for the
whole cure; the minister of St. John&rsquo;s, <i>nil</i>.&nbsp;
While for the last three or four years the pew-rents of St.
Mary&rsquo;s have more than met the ordinary expenses of that
church; although there have been two Services performed in it
daily during that period.&nbsp; And &ldquo;increased church
accommodation is loudly called for in Paddington!&rdquo;&nbsp;
How will the bishop of London, and his lessees, <i>now</i> answer
to that call?&nbsp; Will the rate-payers of Paddington be left to
answer it?&nbsp; Or, will the vestry of this parish, elected
under the provisions of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act, be allowed,
of their own mere motion, (without any reference to the
rate-payer, or without any efficient representation of the case
&ldquo;in all its bearings,&rdquo; to the bishop and his
lessees), to take upon themselves to spend more of the
rate-payers&rsquo; property?&nbsp; We shall see.</p>
<p>What <i>can</i> be done by those who care one pin about
preserving a state-church; by those who have ground-rents to
preserve, and lands and houses to be benefitted by offering to
in-coming tenants church accommodation, we have already
seen.&nbsp; <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>But another example of voluntary church-building and
self-support exists in this parish.</p>
<p>Mr. B. Macaulay tell us, when speaking of the revenues of the
State, &ldquo;experience has fully proved that the voluntary
liberality of individuals, even in times of the greatest
excitement, is a poor financial resource when compared with
severe and methodical taxation, which, presses on the willing and
unwilling alike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who govern the state-church,
have had experience on this head; and without stopping
&ldquo;voluntary liberality&rdquo; they deem it necessary, so
long as a state-religion is upheld, to use &ldquo;severe and
methodical taxation;&rdquo; and they employ all the powers the
law allows them, to compel the unwilling, as well as the willing,
to pay their appointed share of the particular tax raised for its
requirements.&nbsp; But it is questioned by some most sincere and
learned churchmen, whether this is good policy; whether the
people love the church any better for being obliged to pay
church-rates, when they see how the property claimed by the
church is apportioned; and where they see, as in this parish,
church property, much more than sufficient to supply their
religious requirements, used, not for their benefit, as it was
originally intended, but for individual advantage.</p>
<p>But to shew how thoroughly the religious forms of the
state-church <i>can</i> be upheld by the voluntary system alone,
even in a parish from which that church has derived vast sums of
money, and to which it has returned so little, it is only
necessary to mention that</p>
<h4>The Chapel of the Lock Hospital,</h4>
<p>is not only self-supporting, but a portion of the income
derived from the pew-rents annually goes towards the support of
the hospital and asylum.</p>
<p>The pew-rents of the Lock Chapel, for the year ending the
thirty-first of December, 1851, amounted to &pound;948 3<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i>, <a name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a> and this department of a charitable
Institution, &ldquo;after bearing all the expenses incident to
its services, yielded to the Institution, the sum of &pound;348
19<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>&rdquo; during the same period.</p>
<p>Another such an example as this, a third, might have proved
too much; and it was not allowed to exist, although the
foundations of the building were laid, and the means were in hand
to raise the superstructure.&nbsp; The correspondence between the
proprietor of the intended chapel, and the Bishop of London, on
the subject of this new church, proposed to be <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>built at
Westbourn Green, must be fresh in the memory of most readers of
the daily journals; and it is only necessary to refer those, who
wish to know the history of an attempt to erect another church in
this parish upon the voluntary principle, to that
correspondence.</p>
<p>At the present time, the parish of Paddington is divided into
five ecclesiastical districts; and the episcopal form of
church-government and the present forms of the state-religion,
are supported by accomplished clergymen, attached to the various
places of public worship.</p>
<p>The people of Paddington see in their own parish an
exemplification of that state of church economy, which is more or
less prominently exhibited all over the country; they know the
extent of the church-lands here; they know how they were
acquired; they know for the performance of what duties these
lands were granted; they see how the income from these lands has
been disposed of; they know that the duties of providing for
religion, and for the poor, have been transferred from the
holders of this church-land, to those who occupy the houses which
have been built on it; and they know that a second Reformation is
inevitable.&nbsp; So that, if the church ministers of this parish
could report to their bishop, that no dissenter lived in this
very profitable part of his diocese, it would convey to him no
more accurate notion of the feeling of the people respecting the
management of the state-church than the bishops conveyed to Laud
&ldquo;on the very eve of troubles, fatal to himself, and to his
order,&rdquo; when they reported to him &ldquo;that not a single
dissenter was to be found within their jurisdiction.&rdquo; <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a></p>
<p>That those dignitaries of the church, who have taken upon
themselves the disposal of the church-lands in Paddington, should
have made such sorry provisions for the promulgation and
protection of their own creed in this place, is much more
surprising, than that they should have looked with no favourable
eye on the diffusion of doctrines which differed, in any respect,
from their own.&nbsp; To prevent, so far as in them lay, the
erection of any places of worship, save those in which were
taught the particular dogmas they reverenced, is but what
experience teaches us, might have been expected, as it is well
known to be the common practice of every dominant sect to permit
no rival near its throne; or, if a rival is to be tolerated
without a systematic opposition, it must be one that is not
seriously antagonistic to its principles.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>The
Bishop of London, in his last Charge to his clergy, while
guarding them against a too great leaning to Popish practices,
told them there was less danger to fear from Rome, than from
Germany.&nbsp; And, so far as danger to the peculiar dogmas, and
the histrionic ceremonies we have seen spring up within the last
few years, is concerned, all who know anything of the
&ldquo;Reformation of the nineteenth century,&rdquo; as it is
being developed in Germany, will readily admit.&nbsp; To get a
good insight into the &ldquo;Humane Reformation&rdquo; now in
progress not only in Germany, but in England and America, I must
refer my readers to the little Work which has been published for
the English reader by the great apostle of this Reformation,
Johannes Ronge, and to which I have before alluded.</p>
<p>The present Bishop of London and his predecessors, I am
credibly informed, have considered it to be their duty to
prevent, so far as in them lay, the erection of any Dissenting
place of worship in Paddington.&nbsp; But some part of the
Paddington Estate was leased without any restrictive provisions
of this nature, therefore the whole of the land in Paddington is
not now in the hands of a dominant church.</p>
<p>In 1816, a chapel, capable of holding six hundred persons,
with school-rooms on the basement story, was built in
Praed-street, on ground leased by the Grand Junction Canal
Company.</p>
<p>This chapel, &ldquo;The Tabernacle,&rdquo; is now in the hands
of a congregation of Baptists, who, to purchase and repair it,
incurred a debt of &pound;2,000.&nbsp; This they have paid off
within the last ten years, over and above their contributions for
the support of their minister.&nbsp; They also educate upwards of
two hundred scholars; and twenty-three teachers give their
leisure on the day of rest for this purpose.</p>
<p>There is a freehold chapel in the Harrow Road, at the entrance
to Paddington Green; the Wesleyans have a chapel in the
Queen&rsquo;s Road, Bayswater; and the Roman Catholics are now
building a large church at the western extremity of this parish,
on a portion of that land, which was bequeathed by the Lady
Margaret, to the poor.&nbsp; Another chapel, called &ldquo;the
Boatman&rsquo;s chapel,&rdquo; also exists in Paddington, on the
ground leased to the Grand Junction Canal Company.&nbsp; This
place of worship, which is capable of holding two hundred
persons, was constructed out of a stable and coach-house, at the
expense of a few pious individuals, who saw how much the poor
boatmen wanted the advantages which accrue from <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>religious
instruction, and how little likely they were to get it in a
parish-church which could not hold one-fourth part of the settled
inhabitants.&nbsp; This little place of worship is in connection
with &ldquo;Paddington Chapel&rdquo;&mdash;a place of worship
belonging to the Independents.&nbsp; To attend the latter, the
people of Paddington have to cross the Queen&rsquo;s highway; as
they have, to go to the chapels in John Street, and New Church
Street.</p>
<p>These very commodious places of worship in St. Marylebone, are
served by learned men, who believe that the religion of the poor
carpenter&rsquo;s son needs neither rich bishops nor rich
endowments, to preserve its existence in this world; and they are
supported in this belief by a very considerable number of tenants
on the Bishop of London&rsquo;s Estate.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">SCHOOLS&mdash;CHARITABLE
INSTITUTIONS&mdash;PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS OF
PUBLIC UTILITY.</span></p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Sunday School</span>, in connection with
the Church, was established in Paddington, during the last
century; but it was not till the beginning of this, that any
public means of instruction existed for the children of the poor
on week days.&nbsp; Lysons, in his second Edition, tells us that
&ldquo;A charity school for thirty boys and thirty girls was
established in this parish in 1802;&rdquo; and that it was
&ldquo;supported by voluntary contributions, and the collections
at an annual charity sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; This public day-school
for poor children was one of the first established in the
outskirts of London; and the school room was built on that land
which is said to have been given by Bishop Compton.&nbsp; But
this building was but small; for it held only one hundred
children; and in 1816, it was discovered that there were 1508
children under twelve years of age, living on the south side of
the canal only; and it was supposed that four hundred of these
were between seven and twelve years old.</p>
<p>The curate of the parish and other influential inhabitants,
seeing this great field open for profitable cultivation, got up a
Committee, to devise ways and means to effect so desirable an
object.&nbsp; This Committee reported to the vestry, in March,
1818, that &ldquo;the Bishop of London, as the most extensive
proprietor as well as the patron of the church, &amp;c.&rdquo;
had been consulted on the propriety of establishing a school for
three hundred children; which they calculated might be supported
for &pound;175 per annum, while the expense of building the
school room, was estimated at &pound;650; and they further
reported to the vestry, that the bishop expressed &ldquo;his
hearty good wishes for its success.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as
&ldquo;hearty good wishes&rdquo; did not build or endow the
school, it was not built till some years after this time; and
then, not by the bishop, or his lay lessees.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>As we
have already seen, the proceeds of the sale of waste lands were
devoted to this purpose; Denis Chirac&rsquo;s legacy, which, with
interest, now amounted to &pound;170 3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, and
a donation of &pound;130 from Baron Maseres, one of his
executors, being added; and in 1828, the vestry resolved to
devote two-thirds of the proceeds of the copyhold estate to the
support of this school.</p>
<p>When the Act of 1838, relative to the freehold estates, was
obtained, a re-arrangement of these funds was made; and
three-fifths of the whole estates, freehold as well as leasehold,
were appropriated &ldquo;towards the support of the
<i>Paddington</i> Parochial National and Infant
Schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new school rooms were built in 1822 on
Paddington Green, or rather on a part of the site of the
&ldquo;town pool;&rdquo; and in 1831, other school rooms, in
connection with that system which is called National, were built
at Bayswater.</p>
<p>In 1840 the parochial school-rooms of St. John&rsquo;s
district were erected in Tichbourn Row; and the new schools,
built at the back of Stanley Street, and St. Mary&rsquo;s
Hospital, in the district of All Saints, were opened in February,
1852.</p>
<p>The Rev. F. C. Cook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report on Schools in the
Eastern district,&rdquo; published in &ldquo;Minutes of the
Committee of Council on Education 1845,&rdquo; contains a full
account of those schools then in operation; and the following
extracts are taken from it.</p>
<p>In 1845, the number of scholars was as follows, viz., in the
schools on Paddington Green, April fifth and sixth, &ldquo;200
boys present, total 210; 115 girls present, total 131; 180
infants present, total 190.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Titchbourn Street, second of April, Boys present, 167;
total, 190.&nbsp; Girls present, 91; total, 109.&nbsp; Infants
present, 151; total 200.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bayswater, twenty-fifth April.&nbsp; Boys, 106; girls,
49; infants, 60.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masters and mistresses of these schools, and of the new
school, have kindly furnished me with the numbers now in
attendance; they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Mr.
Cook reported, that at the schools on Paddington Green,
&ldquo;the boys and girls are instructed in two rooms,
well-built, warmed and ventilated.&nbsp; The building handsome,
and well arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys: instructed by master, with pupil teacher,
seventeen years old, who was educated in the school.&nbsp;
Arranged in six classes on the circulating system.&nbsp; The
rewards for medals are books, which cost about &pound;5 per
annum.&nbsp; The attendance averages more than nine-tenths of the
total number.&nbsp; Age of boys between seven and twelve,
excepting ten boys near thirteen years.&nbsp; Many boys have been
in school from infancy.&nbsp; There is an increase of fifty since
the last inspection.&nbsp; The fluctuation in the numbers not
considerable.&nbsp; Boys are very healthy and cleanly in
appearance.&nbsp; The discipline is nearly perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general proportion of instruction in the several
classes is somewhat advanced since last year.&nbsp; In the first
class of fifty boys, averaging eleven years old, and three years
in school, twenty-five work a sum in practice, 9860874, at
&pound;35 10<i>s.</i> 6&frac12;<i>d.</i>, with ease; the others
compound rules and proportion.&nbsp; Write exceedingly well from
dictation, and some good abstracts.&nbsp; Geography, grammar, and
etymology well taught.&nbsp; Read History of England fluently,
and are acquainted with the facts.&nbsp; Learn linear drawing,
and music on Hullah&rsquo;s method.&nbsp; The lower classes are
advancing in due proportion to age and time in school.&nbsp; The
religious instruction throughout is good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generally speaking, methods of teaching are those of
the National Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls: instructed in two rooms, and four classes, by
mistress, assistant and monitors.&nbsp; From seven to thirteen
years old; fifteen, between twelve and thirteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manners of the girls are very pleasing, and the
school is in good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All can read from easy narrative, to the third book and
History of England.&nbsp; Eighty read with ease in the third
book.&nbsp; Good secular reading books in all classes.&nbsp;
Writing on paper, ninety in books, and from memory, neat and
accurate.&nbsp; Ciphering to compound rules, with practical
questioning.&nbsp; The first class learn geography and grammar
very well; the religious instruction in all classes is remarkably
good.&nbsp; Needlework is very well taught; thirty can fix a
shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infants, one hundred and eighty.&nbsp; Conducted by a
mistress; assistant employed in managing, not in instructing the
children.&nbsp; <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>A handsome, well-arranged school, with abundant
apparatus.&nbsp; All infants between two and six years.&nbsp; The
infants are cheerful, orderly, clean, and fond of their
mistress.&nbsp; It is peculiar to the school that the mistress
teaches all the children to read, &amp;c., without
monitors.&nbsp; The result is that they are more advanced than in
good infant schools conducted on the usual system; seventy read
in books; twenty very well; and twenty write sentences on slates,
twenty, words; and thirty, letters; all elementary subjects are
well-taught.&nbsp; Children are well acquainted with scriptural
history, and give more intelligent answers on meaning of words
and sentences than is usual in good schools.&nbsp; The mistress
is an able teacher, and devoted to her duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cook adds, &ldquo;I have recommended many clergymen to
visit these schools, as among the best and most complete in
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he concludes this part of his report by saying, that
&ldquo;in addition to these nine schools, it is intended to erect
others in the neighbourhood of the new church, which will make
altogether provision for the instruction of 2000 children, in a
population of 25,000.&nbsp; The present schools cost nearly
&pound;1,300 per annum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The expenditure of these
schools varies, as a matter of course; and this sum must not be
taken as the present expenditure.&nbsp; The new schools will cost
&pound;400 per annum, in addition to this sum; and I find that in
1847&ndash;48, the total expenditure of St. John&rsquo;s schools
for the year, amounted to &pound;591; the income being made up of
&pound;336, subscriptions, donations, and collections; &pound;140
paid by scholars in the form of &ldquo;school pence;&rdquo; and
&pound;115 from other sources.&nbsp; By another report I find
that the sum paid by the children at Paddington Green, amounted
in the year to &pound;130.</p>
<p>All these schools have received, and continue to receive,
grants from the Parliamentary Fund.&nbsp; For the year ending
thirty-first of October, 1850, I find the schools on Paddington
Green, had an award of &pound;135 10<i>s.</i>; Bayswater, of
&pound;67 10<i>s.</i>; and St. John&rsquo;s, of &pound;65
10<i>s.</i>, &ldquo;to apprentices and teachers, for their
instruction;&rdquo; with an additional grant of &pound;9
7<i>s.</i> 2&frac34;<i>d.</i>, to St. John&rsquo;s for
&ldquo;books and maps.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Government grant for the
All Saints schools was &pound;180; the cost of the site,
&pound;640, and the building of these schools amounted,
altogether, to &pound;2,173 7<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; which sum was
raised by donations and subscription from the inhabitants of the
parish, with the exception of the grant just mentioned, and one
hundred pounds given by the Bishop of London.&nbsp; <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>But before
these new schools were erected, the population of Paddington
numbered upwards of 46,000; and 1816, is the actual number of
scholars on the books of the twelve schools at the present time,
(January, 1853).</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;Blue Book,&rdquo; which contains the answers
to Questions on education, printed by order of the House of
Commons, twentieth March, 1835, we learn, that the first infant
school in this parish was commenced in 1833; that it then
contained fifty children of both sexes, and was supported
principally at the cost of the individual who established it, but
partly by the payment of two-pence per week from the parent with
each child.&nbsp; We are also informed by this inquiry, that a
school for fifty females was established at Bayswater, and
supported by Mrs. Sutcliffe, of Orme-square.&nbsp; From this
&ldquo;Blue Book&rdquo; we also learn, that to each of the four
&ldquo;day and Sunday National Schools,&rdquo; and to two of the
Dissenters&rsquo; Sunday schools a lending library is attached, a
most excellent provision which has been extended since that
period to the other schools; but the books are obtainable only
upon the scholars conforming to certain regulations.</p>
<p>Although the reports of the Tichbourn-street, and Bayswater
schools, were not quite so favourable, in 1845, as the
Paddington-green school; and although from subsequent reports, we
find the Paddington-green schools suffered from change of
teachers, while the others were more favourably reported on, yet
the published annual reports of the Inspector, to which I must
refer for further information, shew that, on the whole, the
schools of Paddington may be looked on as amongst the best of
those which follow the peculiar methods of teaching laid down by
the &ldquo;National Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masters, and mistresses, and those who have the management
of these schools, evidently do their duty; and the instruction
given is highly valuable.&nbsp; But whether it was right to apply
the proceeds of the sales of waste lands, and three-fifths of all
the charity estates of this parish, exclusively to those schools
which adopt the methods of teaching instituted by the
&ldquo;National Society,&rdquo; may, I think, be justly
questioned; seeing that the greater portion, if not the whole of
that property, was given to the poor <i>generally</i>, and not to
those <i>only</i>, who were willing to have their children taught
a particular Catechism, and a particular Belief.</p>
<p>Out of Paddington there are systems of teaching, which do not
base themselves on peculiar and sectarian tenets; and in which,
learning controversial portions of scripture, in
&ldquo;proof&rdquo; <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>of the truth of a catechism, does
not form an essential element.&nbsp; Many learned men, whose
religious principles cannot be called in question, do not approve
of this catechism, or of this teaching; and they believe the
first Society established, the British and Foreign School
Society, advocate a system more <i>national</i> than that of the
self styled National Society.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rational
Schools,&rdquo; too, are not unknown&mdash;even within &ldquo;a
stone&rsquo;s throw of the High Court of Chancery&rdquo; <a
name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169"
class="citation">[169]</a>&mdash;but Dr. Birkbeck&rsquo;s plan is
<i>too rational</i> for the Parochial schools of Paddington.</p>
<p>The foundation stone of the &ldquo;Westbourne Schools,&rdquo;
conducted on the &ldquo;Glasgow Training System,&rdquo; was laid
on the thirty-first July, 1850.&nbsp; This excellent
establishment, which is in connection with the Lock Chapel, is
built by the side of &ldquo;the green lanes,&rdquo; (the old road
which led from the Great Western-road to the Harrow-road,) and is
now in full operation.</p>
<p>The different congregations of Dissenters, too, have schools
attached to their respective chapels; and the Roman Catholics
have built a large school room in connection with their new
chapel.</p>
<p>There are, also, many excellent private schools in Paddington;
but of schools strictly private, I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>In July 1848, the &ldquo;Paddington Wharfs Ragged
Schools,&rdquo; for infants, girls, and boys, were opened in
Kent&rsquo;s place; but in December of the same year, larger
premises in Church-place were taken.&nbsp; These have been found
too small, and the Committee have incurred a considerable expense
in making them more convenient.&nbsp; The average attendance is
set down in the third annual report at one hundred and ten
infants, thirty girls, and forty boys.&nbsp; In the adult schools
there were twenty pupils; and the scholars in the evening and
Sunday schools vary from forty-five to ninety.&nbsp; The current
expenses tor 1851, amounted to &pound;206 7<i>s.</i>

<p>There are two small establishments at Bayswater for female
orphans.&nbsp; The one called the &ldquo;Orphan Asylum,&rdquo;
was instituted in 1833, by Mrs. Sutcliffe and other ladies
connected with the private charity school, which was supported
for many years by that lady&rsquo;s generosity.&nbsp; The other,
called the &ldquo;Bayswater Episcopal Female Orphan
School,&rdquo; was established in 1839.&nbsp; The former of these
establishments contained fourteen female orphans in 1851, the
current expenses for the year, being &pound;251 4<i>s.</i>
2&frac34;<i>d.</i>&nbsp; In the latter, in the same year, there
were sixteen <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>orphans, and the expenditure amounted to &pound;335
17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Both institutions are supported by
voluntary contributions.</p>
<p>Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Lying-in-Hospital, now situated in the
New-road, was originally established in Paddington; Lysons tells
us the Naval Asylum was removed to Greenwich from this place; and
the &ldquo;School of Industry for Female Orphans,&rdquo; which
was &ldquo;instituted in Church street, Paddington Green, in
1786, for the maintenance and education of twenty-four
children&rdquo; is about to be removed to their new premises in
St. John&rsquo;s Wood-road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Paddington Visiting Society,&rdquo; was established
in the year 1838; its objects being &ldquo;to promote the
religious and moral improvement of the poor, in co-operation with
the parochial clergy, to relieve distress and sickness, to
encourage industry, frugality, and provident habits, and
generally, to cultivate a friendly intercourse between the poor
and the wealthier and more educated classes of
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was proposed to effect these objects by
means of district visiting, in connection with provident
institutions, and visiting societies or church
associations.&nbsp; The Provident Dispensary in Star-street;
Provident Funds, and lending libraries connected with the
schools; and the Paddington Savings&rsquo; Bank, have arisen out
of this parent Institution.&nbsp; And, although some of the
district visitors may have been over ardent in pressing on the
poor, the necessity of observing certain forms, as one of the
conditions of their assistance, yet undoubtedly these
associations have done much good.&nbsp; I must refer to the
annual reports of these charitable Institutions for the detailed
account of their operations; but I may mention here, that the
church association in connection with St. John&rsquo;s District,
collected during the year 1851, &pound;1,105 10<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i> besides &pound;128 1<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, contributed
to a fund, called the &ldquo;additional curate&rsquo;s
fund,&rdquo; &ldquo;designed for the increased visitation of the
sick and poor at their own houses, and the maintenance of a daily
service in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The block of small alms-houses at present existing in the
Harrow-road, said to have been built in 1714, on a portion of
what had been Paddington Green, is the oldest charitable building
in Paddington; but the endowment, if there ever was one, has
merged into other estates; for no endowment now exists.&nbsp;
Sixteen poor old women belonging to the parish, are still
supported there out of the poor rates; but the inmates think
themselves not so far degraded as they would be, if obliged to
become tenants of the great parish poor-house; although in the
latter they might have a less confined <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>crib, and
perhaps, a more generous diet; but <i>there</i> they would not be
free.&nbsp; Now they can ramble about at pleasure; and when at
home, for each little room is a home, they can dwell upon the
remembrance of those pretty little flower gardens, which formerly
existed in front of these almshouses, and which may have
attracted them in their younger days, when perhaps, they little
thought of becoming the recipients of alms.&nbsp; With the
alteration of the Harrow-road, which added &ldquo;thirty feet in
depth&rdquo; to the church-yard, and I presume the same quantity
to that strip of the Green, which was so kindly offered to the
parish for four thousand pounds, and a portion of which was
purchased for &pound;2,000, these little attractions vanished;
and a considerable portion of the &ldquo;thirteen feet ten
inches&rdquo; of flower garden, which existed on the north side
of this charitable institution, now forms a part of the altered
road; while on the garden to the south, the vestry-room, the
police-station, the infant-school, and other buildings, have been
erected.</p>
<p>The great charitable Institution of modern Paddington, is St.
Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, situated in Cambridge-place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Its establishment was commenced in 1843, and His Royal
Highness Prince Albert was pleased to lay the first stone on the
twenty-eighth of June, 1845.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thomas Hopper, Esq.
made the design gratuitously; and Mr. Winsland&rsquo;s tender of
&pound;33,787 was accepted for the building; which, when
complete, was intended to hold 380 beds.</p>
<p>A portion of this building, &ldquo;with all the requisite
appurtenances, capable of containing 150 beds,&rdquo; was opened
for the reception of fifty patients on the thirteenth of June,
1851; 332 patients were admitted into the wards of the Hospital,
during the first six months; the average duration of their stay
being twenty two days.</p>
<p>Mr. Winsland&rsquo;s original tender was for the whole
building, included &ldquo;in five separate divisions;&rdquo; and
a certain portion was to have been completed within a specified
period, but the sudden death of the contractor is said to have
thrown some obstacles in the way of its progress.&nbsp; There
must have been some alteration, too, in the original design, or
some sad miscalculation in the contract; for instead of a
building capable of containing 380 beds having been erected for
&pound;33,787, I find by a &ldquo;statement and appeal&rdquo;
published by &ldquo;the Bond of Governors&rdquo; in 1851, that
there had been expended the end of that year &pound;33,806
5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> &ldquo;on account site and building,&rdquo;
<i>as it then existed</i>: &pound;1,776 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, in
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>addition, had been expended in furnishing; and
&pound;1,223 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, for the maintenance of the
fifty beds for six months.&nbsp; The estimated sum &ldquo;to
maintain the establishment of 150 beds, and to defray the expense
of out-patients,&rdquo; was calculated at &pound;4,400 per annum;
&pound;300 additional being required to support the maternity
department.</p>
<p>At the present time there are 150 beds for patients, the total
number the present building is capable of containing; and
attendance on the practice of this Hospital is now recognised by
the medical examining boards&mdash;the medical staff having been
complete from the first opening of the establishment.&nbsp; This
staff consists of three Physicians, and three Assistant
Physicians; three Surgeons, and three Assistant Surgeons; a
Physician-Accoucheur; a Surgeon-Accoucheur; an
Ophthalmic-Surgeon; and an Aural-Surgeon; all of whom perform
their respective duties gratuitously.&nbsp; There are also two
resident medical officers, and a Dispenser.&nbsp; There is a paid
Secretary; an Assistant Secretary; a Collector; a Matron; and a
Chaplain; and the establishment is managed by a certain number of
Governors elected on building, special, house, finance, and
medical committees; subject to a code of laws, and, in most
instances, to the will of the whole body of Governors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every subscriber of three guineas or upwards annually,
is eligible to be elected an annual governor; and every
individual, making a donation of thirty guineas or upwards in one
sum, is eligible to be elected a life governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every governor, in addition to the privilege of
recommending in and out-patients as a subscriber, has the right
to attend at all, or any weekly, quarterly or special boards, and
to speak and vote on all questions, and to vote on all elections
which shall come before such board; &amp;c.,&rdquo; but &ldquo;no
governor is entitled to vote on an election, until he shall have
been a governor for a period of three calendar months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annual subscribers of twenty-five guineas, or
<i>donors</i> of 500 guineas in one sum, have an unlimited right
of recommending in-patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annual subscribers of ten guineas, or <i>donors</i> of
100 guineas in one sum, may recommend an unlimited number of
in-patients, one in-patient only at a time in the Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annual subscribers of three guineas, or <i>donors</i>
of thirty guineas in one sum, may recommend three in-patients
annually, and eighteen out-patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annual subscribers of two guineas, or <i>donors</i> of
twenty <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>guineas in one sum, may recommend two in-patients
annually, and twelve out-patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annual subscribers of one guinea, or <i>donors</i> of
ten guineas in one sum to the maternity fund, may recommend three
patients annually <i>to that department</i>; and three additional
patients for each guinea annually subscribed, or each donation of
ten guineas in one sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, although great sums have been already subscribed, and
although these inducements to subscribe have been held out to the
charitable, the Hospital is already in debt; and the
advertisements declare that &ldquo;to maintain the present number
of in-patients, and to supply medicine for a very large number of
out-patients, the amount of annual subscriptions is quite
inadequate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what has been seen in the previous part of this Work, it
may have been thought that the site of this Hospital, with the
whole of its enclosed ground, was the gift of the Bishop of
London and the trustees of the Paddington Estate; but from a
printed statement, dated the tenth of July, 1846, I find that
this is not the case.&nbsp; The ground which was to be given up,
according to the provisions of the 7th and 8th Vic. chap. 30, as
a site for this Hospital, is said to consist &ldquo;of upwards of
three quarters of an acre;&rdquo; &ldquo;its value was stated to
have been estimated at &pound;3,885;&rdquo; but &ldquo;the
trustees of the Hospital were required to pay &pound;1,000, as an
indemnity to the Grand Junction Water Works Company, to whom the
ground had been leased.&rdquo;&nbsp; Further, the Committee
&ldquo;deemed it expedient to purchase, at an expense of
&pound;2,000 two adjoining pieces of ground, in order that the
future governors of the institution should not be restricted in
their operations for want of space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These pieces together, made &ldquo;an acre and a quarter of
land, being nearly half an acre more than the present site of St.
George&rsquo;s Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few yards of this large building, there is another
charitable medical Institution, called the &ldquo;Paddington Free
Dispensary, for the Diseases of women and children.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This Institution, also, is supported by voluntary contributions;
and a consulting physician; a consulting surgeon; two physicians;
a surgeon; a dentist; and a secretary; give their gratuitous
services to this charity.&nbsp; The report of 1851, states that
5,280 patients had been &ldquo;admitted during the last
year;&rdquo; the expenditure of the whole establishment being but
&pound;218 18<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>
<p>In the same street&mdash;Market-street,&mdash;there is a
&ldquo;Refuge for <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>the Destitute&rdquo; supported by voluntary
contributions.&nbsp; Here the houseless poor, to the number of
100, may obtain a bed and breakfast during the winter months; and
here, winter and summer, the manager and his wife have been
maintained for some years in very easy circumstances. <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a></p>
<p>For the regular poor of the parish, a very excellent house has
been built, at a cost of &pound;11,431 9<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, on
a portion of five and a quarter acres of &ldquo;the Upper
Readings,&rdquo; purchased of the Bishop of London and the
trustees of the Paddington Estate for &pound;5,168 15<i>s.</i>
0<i>d.</i> <a name="citation174b"></a><a href="#footnote174b"
class="citation">[174b]</a>&mdash;By an &ldquo;extract from the
statistical and financial statements of accounts of the Board of
Guardians,&rdquo; I find that for the half year ending
Michaelmas, 1851, the total number of paupers relieved was 1,054,
viz.&mdash;in-door, 88 males; 126 females; 117 children.&nbsp;
Out-door, 122 males; 289 females; 312 children.&nbsp; The
collective number of days being 37,171.&nbsp; I also find, from
the same official document, that there was an increase of 36
in-door, and a decrease of 160 out-door paupers as compared with
the corresponding half of the previous year; that the total
expenditure for the relief of the poor, amounted to &pound;2,995
16<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i>; that the sum of &pound;1,130
10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was repaid for &ldquo;workhouse loan and
interest;&rdquo; and that the whole cost of the establishment for
this half-year was &pound;4,237 16<i>s.</i>
8&frac12;<i>d.</i>&mdash;&pound;4,500 having been called for to
meet the expenditure.&nbsp; The financial account closed with a
balance in hand of &pound;1,154 10<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i></p>
<p>From the same kind of printed document, for the half-year
ending lady-day, 1852, I find the total number of paupers
relieved, was 1,070; viz., in-door, 70 males; 139 females; 101
children; out-door, 135 males; 290 females; 335 children; being a
decrease of 120 out, and 26 in-door paupers, as compared with the
corresponding half of the previous year; the collective number of
days, being 36,738.&nbsp; The in-maintenance and clothing for
this half-year, amounted to &pound;892 16<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>;
the &ldquo;establishment and common charges,&rdquo; to &pound;830
6<i>s.</i> 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>; the out-relief to 1,056 7<i>s.</i>
10&frac34;<i>d.</i>; the lunatic charges to &pound;315
14<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; and the extra medical fees to &pound;27
4<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, making the total expenditure for the
relief of the poor this half-year &pound;3,122 9<i>s.</i>
5<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Payment of interest, registration fees, &amp;c.,
increased this sum to &pound;3,474 18<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
The amount called for this half-year was &pound;2,700 0<i>s.</i>
0<i>d.</i>, and &pound;410 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, was the amount
of balance in hand.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>The
Lock Hospital, which adjoins the Work-house, was removed from
Grosvenor-place to its present site, in 1842.&nbsp; This
institution was founded in 1737, and no less than 60,502 patients
have been treated at this Hospital since that date.&nbsp; The
number of in-patients for 1851, was 388; of these 193 were
females, and 195 males; during the same period 785 persons were
attended to, as out-patients.&nbsp; Attached to this charity, and
indeed forming an important portion of it, is &ldquo;the
Asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lock Asylum was founded in the year 1787, by the
Rev. Thomas Scott, the venerable commentator.&nbsp; It then
occupied a building in connection with the old Lock
Hospital.&nbsp; In 1842, it was removed to its present site, and
in 1848&ndash;9, enlarged to its present dimensions.&nbsp; When
first founded, the Asylum received only sixteen inmates; in 1842,
it was enlarged so as to receive twenty; it is now capable of
containing 100.</p>
<p>Since the foundation of the Asylum, 1,175 female patients of
the Hospital have been admitted, a majority of whom have been
provided with situations, restored to their friends, or otherwise
comfortably settled in life.</p>
<p>There are now forty-seven in the Asylum.</p>
<p>Needlework is taken in at the Asylum, and the payment for it
constitutes a valuable addition to the receipts of the
Institution.&nbsp; A laundry is open also for the washing of
those families who may be willing, by sending the work, thus
further to benefit the Asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the chapel and the schools, which have sprung out of
these charitable institutions, there are now connected with them
and the chapel, the following societies, viz. The Westbourn
Friendly Visiting Society, the Westbourn Provident Bank, the Lock
Sunday schools, the Church Missionary Association, the Juvenile
Missionary Association, the Sunday School Children&rsquo;s
Missionary Association, the Church of England Young Men&rsquo;s
Society; and the London City Mission.</p>
<p>The Public Establishments in Paddington, unconnected with
particular forms of religion, are soon recounted:</p>
<p>Here there are no places for rational amusement&mdash;unless
indeed, we consider such places as &ldquo;the Flora
tea-gardens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bott&rsquo;s Bowling-green,&rdquo;
to come under this designation.&nbsp; In that region of the
parish still devoted to bull-dogs, and pet spaniels; the bodies
of broken-down carriages, old wheels, rusty grates, and old
copper boilers; little gardens, and low miserable sheds; there is
an establishment, which boasts of <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>having the truly attractive glass,
in which &ldquo;for the small charge of two-pence, any young lady
may behold her future husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; But although such
attractions as these exist, the youths who live on the celebrated
Paddington Estate, have not to thank the lords of the soil for
setting apart any portion of it for their physical improvement;
and yet for the efficient development both of mind and body, it
is necessary that the physical condition of the young should be
cared for.&nbsp; In Paddington, however, there is no public
gymnasium; there is now no village-green, worthy of the name; <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a> the young are not trained to use their
motive powers to the best advantage; there are no public
baths.&nbsp; And when, on the establishment of the baths and
washhouses in Marylebone, the governing Body in Paddington was
solicited to join in that useful work, that good office was
rejected, and the people of Marylebone were permitted to carry
out that necessary and useful undertaking by themselves.&nbsp;
Perhaps the Paddington vestrymen thought there ought to be a
bath, and a bath-room, in every house in Paddington; if so they
certainly thought rightly.&nbsp; But how many of these necessary
adjuncts to a healthful home are to be found even on the
Paddington Estate, and what steps have our local governors taken
to supply this want in the houses of the poor?</p>
<p>In particular religious communities, the education of those
who can no longer be called children, is beginning to be attended
to, in some degree; yet there is no public lecture room; no
museum; no public reading room; no place of general instruction
in Paddington, where Jew and Gentile, saint and sinner, alike may
meet to receive lessons from that fountain of truth which ought
to be open to all mankind, irrespectively of their private
religious opinions.</p>
<p>And yet in Paddington we see some of the most miraculous signs
of the times.&nbsp; A city of palaces has sprung up on a
bishop&rsquo;s estate within twenty years; a road of iron, with
steeds of steam, brings into the centre of this city, and takes
from it in one year, a greater number of living beings than could
be found in all England a few years ago.&nbsp; The electric
telegraph is at work by the side of this iron road.&nbsp; And by
means of conveyances, open to all who have any small change, from
sixpence to a penny, the whole of London can be traversed <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>in half the
time it took to reach Holborn-bar at the beginning of this
century, when the road was in the hands of Mr. Miles, his
pair-horse coach, and his redoubtable Boy.&nbsp; This coach and
these celebrated characters were for a long time the only
appointed agents of communication between Paddington and the
City.&nbsp; The journey to the City was performed by them in
something more than three hours; the charge for each outside
passenger being two shillings, the &ldquo;insides&rdquo; being
expected to pay three.&nbsp; The delivery of parcels on the line
of road added very materially to Mr. Miles&rsquo;s occupation and
profit; and I am informed that Miles&rsquo;s Boy not only told
tales, to the great amusement of his master&rsquo;s customers,
but gave them some equally amusing variations on an old fiddle,
which was his constant travelling companion, and which he
carefully removed from its green-baize covering, to beguile the
time at every resting-place on the road.</p>
<p>When the Paddington omnibuses first started, the aristocracy
of &ldquo;The Green&rdquo; were quite shocked at the disgrace
thus brought on the parish; and loud and long were their
complaints to the vestry, and most earnest were their petitions
to that body, to rid them of &ldquo;the nuisance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Since that time, however, greater folks than those of &ldquo;The
Green&rdquo; have not objected to be seated in these public
vehicles; and so useful and necessary to the public have they
become, that one Company of Proprietors of Paddington Omnibuses
has had in use 700 horses at one time.&nbsp; And, if the
Paddington omnibuses were improved, as they easily might be, they
would be much more useful than they are at present.</p>
<p>The glory of the first public Company which shed its influence
over Paddington, has in a great measure departed; the shares of
the Grand Junction Canal Company are below par, though the
traffic on this silent highway to Paddington, is still
considerable; and the cheap trips into the country offered by its
means, during the summer months, are beginning to be highly
appreciated by the people, who are pent in close lanes and
alleys; and I have no doubt the shareholders&rsquo; dividends
would not be diminished by a more liberal attention to this
want.</p>
<p>If every one had their right, I am told there would be a
wharf, adjoining this canal, open free to the people of
Paddington, for loading and unloading goods.&nbsp; It is certain
that the old road to Harrow was never leased to the Grand
Junction Canal Company; but a wharf, upwards of one hundred feet
wide, now exists on a portion of that road; and, as I am
informed, the rent of this wharf is not received by the
parish.&nbsp; <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>I was promised, twelve months since, that the claims of
the parish to this wharf should he inquired into; but as yet no
such inquiry has been made.</p>
<p>At the western extremity of the parish, there is an artesian
well, to which the name of &ldquo;the Western Water Works&rdquo;
has been given; the water from which supplies the houses, which
have been built on that clayey district.&nbsp; The west
Middlesex, and the Grand Junction Water Works Companies supply
the other parts of the parish.</p>
<p>The Imperial Gas Company have supplied the parish with gas,
since its first introduction into Paddington, in 1824.</p>
<p>A new station and hotel, now nearly finished, will make a fine
terminus to the Great Western Railway; and add to the many showy
buildings, which have been erected in Paddington, within the last
few years.</p>

179</span>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">A REVIEW OF THE
CONDITION OF THE PARISH AND THE PEOPLE, AT VARIOUS PERIODS OF
THEIR HISTORY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> people who have been the most
completely governed by ecclesiastics, are proverbial for having
made the slowest progress in all the elements of knowledge which
concern man; and the people of Paddington formed no exception to
that rule which has been found to hold good in other
places.&nbsp; Here, as elsewhere, the spiritual governors of the
people made but poor attempts to develope the mind; and those to
whom they deputed this duty, took care to follow the example set
them by their superiors.</p>
<p>To keep the breath of life, the living soul, under subjection
by the agency of superstitious dogmas and by threats of
everlasting punishment, was attempted for ages, and is even now
attempted; but the world is freeing itself from the government of
organised crafts; and it will soon be useless&mdash;in spite of
all the vain efforts which are now being made&mdash;to attempt to
teach the people that the greatest virtue is <i>to believe and
obey</i>, without the exercise of reason; and that the greatest
vice consists in doubting the power of symbols to save.</p>
<p>Although the people of Paddington lived at so short a distance
from the two rich cathedral marts of London and Westminster, they
made no greater advances in civilization for many centuries, than
did those who lived in the most remote village in England.&nbsp;
The few people who did live here, were wholly agricultural; and
they owed every useful lesson of their lives, much more to their
own intelligence and observation, than to any instruction given
them by those who were well paid to be their teachers.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Paddington, however, is no longer what it was; the lay
element, independent of all craft, has thoroughly diffused itself
through the country; and its advent in this place, though
attended with much cunning, was the real cause of the wonderful
transformation which has taken place here within the last
half-century.</p>
<p>The Reformation and the Revolution added to the numbers and
importance of the people; and the execrable act of that vain
braggart, who wildly called himself the State, not only increased
the population of Paddington, but brought out to useful purpose
the christian virtues of the residents of this village.&nbsp;
Here, on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, many of the
exiled protestants of France found a home, which had been denied
them by their <i>great</i> King; and here, too, the memory of
their sufferings and virtues will be kept green, so long as one
of their graves shall be permitted to remain in the Old
Church-yard.</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell what number of persons lived in this
parish, at any one period previous to the present century.&nbsp;
The oldest Parish Register, now to be found in Paddington, is
dated 1701; and all the written proceedings of the rate-payers in
vestry assembled, previous to the second of April, 1793, are said
to have been burnt, lost, stolen or destroyed.&nbsp; The only
sources from which I have been able to form any conjecture
respecting the ancient population of Paddington, are, therefore,
necessarily very imperfect, and open to many objections.</p>
<p>By the Subsidy Rolls, however, we discover the names of those
who were rated in particular places, at different periods, when
the respective subsidies were levied; and although their
tombstones may have crumbled into dust, or may have been removed
by Act of Parliament, and sold &ldquo;for the best price that
could be got,&rdquo; yet in these tax-papers their names may
receive a notice which will, for centuries, preserve their
memories.</p>
<p>From the Subsidy Roll of the sixteenth year of Henry the
eighth, I find that twenty persons, then living in Paddington,
were taxed for the subsidy levied that year, although the amount
of tax collected in this parish was but forty-eight
shillings.&nbsp; All the heads of families might not have been
included in this levy; but, if we suppose that all were included,
and that each of these twenty persons represented a family, and
if we calculate further five individuals for each family, we
shall make the population of Paddington, in 1524, one hundred;
which in all probability, was not very much under, or over, the
number at that date.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>The
value of land, goods, and wages, on which this sum was assessed,
amounted to &pound;77 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&nbsp; But if these
descriptions of property were all charged in this Subsidy, they
were not taxed in the same proportion, on the capital sum
assessed; for, although the wages of the labourer were taxed,
they were taxed at only one-and-a-quarter per cent.; while goods
were charged two-and-a-half per cent.; and land five per
cent.&nbsp; So that, three hundred years ago, a more equitable
property-tax existed, than that which is the result of present
legislative wisdom.</p>
<p>In the thirty-fifth year of the same reign, the valuation for
this parish was raised to &pound;272 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
Fifteen families only, however, were included in the subsidy for
this year&mdash;land and goods alone being charged.</p>
<p>In a Subsidy Roll, of the thirty-ninth, of Elizabeth,
Marylebone and Paddington are united, to produce a small sum.</p>
<p>In a Subsidy made in the eighteenth year of James the first,
the name of Sir Rowland St. John occurs, as I have before
observed; and, as this is the first time I find the name of a
lessee of the manor on these Rolls, I am inclined to think Sir
Rowland was the first lessee, who lived on the Paddington
Estate.</p>
<p>It was not the son of Sir Rowland, but another Oliver St John,
a relative of this Knight of the Bath, to whom the people owed so
deep a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; That man of noble birth and noble
mind, opposed the Tyranny of his time, not only in thought, but
in word and deed; for he was one of the brave soldiers of that
army, which fought and bled for the liberties we now enjoy; and
the people of Paddington who preserved the sacred mound of
liberty, which they erected within sight of his relatives&rsquo;
windows, must have felt themselves ennobled, when the Lion settle
echoed his valorous deeds.&nbsp; The people of Paddington knew
the value of liberty, if their lords did not; and the public
houses which were the only celebrated institutions in this rural
village, were their debating clubs.&nbsp; Two, at least, were in
existence, before &ldquo;the house for two tenants&rdquo; was
occupied by the lord or his lessees; for they claim to have been
established before the Reformation.&nbsp; There are three lions
still in Paddington, each contending for the most ancient
origin.&nbsp; The &ldquo;White lion,&rdquo; in the Edgeware-road,
was established, according to the date on its present facade, in
1524&mdash;the year in which hops were first permitted to be
imported, to preserve our beer.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo;
in the Edgeware-road, near the commencement of the Harrow-road,
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>claims a
more ancient date for its establishment.&nbsp; In one of its old
wooden chambers, taken down, some few years ago to make room for
the present house, tradition tells us Shakspeare played; <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a> and many a story has been told of the
haunted chamber in this house, as well as of that in the Manor
House.&nbsp; The other ancient &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; also
&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; is situated in the Harrow-road, having taken
up its present position as near to its old quarters, as the
alteration in that road would permit.&nbsp; This house was
formerly situated near the bridge which carried the Harrow-road
over the bourn; and was, as I conceive, the property described in
an Inquisition, held the second year of Edward the
sixth,&mdash;vide p. 51&mdash;as the &ldquo;two tenements, called
the Bridge-House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a younger Lion, &ldquo;Black,&rdquo; but still of
some pretensions to antiquity, standing in the Uxbridge-road;
there is also an ancient &ldquo;Pack Horse,&rdquo; in the
Harrow-road; and at the corner of Old Church-street, in the
Edgeware-road, there is a &ldquo;Wheat Sheaf,&rdquo; which has
the credit of having frequently entertained honest and learned
Ben Johnson; so that, if learning and science were not allowed to
flourish in the churches and other public buildings of
Paddington, the ale houses, in some degree, attempted to supply
the defect.</p>
<p>From the <i>Index Villaris</i> of 1690, I find there were
&ldquo;more than three gentlemen&rsquo;s seats&rdquo; in
Paddington, at that date.&nbsp; Probably there were
four&mdash;Westbourn Manor House; Paddington Manor House;
Desborough House; and Little Shaftsbury House; the two latter
names pointing out their original occupants.</p>
<p>Although I am not now able to offer any positive evidence in
proof of Desborough House having belonged to the celebrated
Colonel, who was related to Cromwell, and whose doings in the
Commonwealth are so well known, yet I have met with many
circumstances which incline me to this belief.</p>
<p>Lysons tells us that Little Shaftesbury House was built by
&ldquo;The Earl of Shaftesbury, author of the Characteristics, or
his father the Chancellor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be no doubt but the population of Paddington was
considerably increased, when the manor and rectory fell into lay
hands; and by making the same computation as before&mdash;five
members for each family, <a name="citation182b"></a><a
href="#footnote182b" class="citation">[182b]</a> we shall find
that <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>by
1685, it had increased to upwards of three-hundred; for, in the
twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth Charles the second, sixty-two
persons are charged for 267 fire-hearths in Paddington: John
Ashley, the gentleman who made the greatest smoke in the parish
at that time, being charged for sixteen.</p>
<p>John Hubbard is not included in this impost; for he did not
live to see all the good results produced by the Restoration,
having died, according to his tombstone, in 1665, &ldquo;aged 111
years.&rdquo; <a name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a"
class="citation">[183a]</a></p>
<p>Lysons has omitted to notice this patriarch in his list of
cases of longevity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether he abstained from doing
so, because John was <i>in some way</i> related to the venerable
lady of that name, and because his tomb was too well known to
require mention, I cannot say.&nbsp; Seeing, however, this tomb
exists when others of more recent date are not to be found, I am
inclined to believe some such historical interest must have
attached to it, or it would have shared the fate of others.&nbsp;
At all events, from John&rsquo;s Diary, if he kept one, many a
story as good as Old Mother Hubbard&rsquo;s could have been
made.</p>
<p>In another part of the church-yard, on the end of a plain,
flat stone, we may read these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the Memory of
Sarah Siddons, who departed this life, June 8th, 1831, in her
76th year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Siddons lived at one time in Paddington; but Mr.
Cunningham tells us, in his Hand-book for London, that the pretty
little house and grounds which she occupied, were destroyed, to
make room for the Great Western Railway; Desborough Lodge,
however, in which I am informed she lived, still stands in the
Harrow-road, a little south and east of the second Canal bridge.
<a name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b"
class="citation">[183b]</a></p>
<p>Poor Haydon, who devoted &ldquo;forty-two years to the
improvement of the taste of the English people in high
art,&rdquo; lived in Paddington; and his shattered corpse was
placed near the spot, where Mrs. Siddons was buried.&nbsp; At no
great distance, Collins, the painter of English coast and cottage
scenery, lies.&nbsp; And Dr. Geddes, the &ldquo;Translator of the
Historical Books of the Old Testament,&rdquo; was buried in
Paddington Church-yard.&nbsp; <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>His surviving friends could engrave
on his tombstone the following sentence from his
works:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Christian is my name, and Catholic my
surname; I grant that you are a Christian as well as I, and
embrace you as my fellow disciple of Jesus; and if you were not a
disciple of Jesus, still I would embrace you as my fellow
man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, because he dared to express his honest conviction, as to
the real origin of the Books he had taken so much trouble to
translate, he was condemned and despised by many zealots, who
thought their hatred a Christian act; and &ldquo;public censure
was passed upon him by the Vicar Apostolic, of the London
district.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Life of this great scholar, and good
man, was published by Dr. Mason Good, in 1803.</p>
<p>Banks the sculptor; the elder George Barret; Merlin the
mechanist; the careful sculptor Nollekins, and his father; the
Marquis of Lansdowne, without a word to mark his tomb, and many
other notables; lie buried in this church and churchyard.&nbsp;
But, although thoughts are to be picked up, by day as well as by
night, in a ramble among the tombs, it is not my intention to
copy all the grave-stones, or to encroach on the province of the
biographer, or village barber, if there be one such useful gossip
still remaining among us.</p>
<p>For a sketch of a people, whether forming a parish or a
nation, it is better to go to their laws, and observe the effects
those laws have produced; than to rely on any description of
individuals, dead or living.&nbsp; With the exception of the
ancient customs of the place, the common law of the land was the
light which guided the people of Paddington, down to the middle
of the last century.&nbsp; Then, as we have already seen, began
the enactment of special laws,&mdash;laws which altered the
relations between those who had duties to perform, and those who
had rights and privileges to protect.</p>
<p>Previous to 1753, the people of this parish managed their own
affairs without external aid, the influential inhabitants
exercising their influence here, as influential people in all
quarters of the world have done, either for their own, or the
public good, according as their selfish passions, or the Eternal
Truth, prevailed within them.&nbsp; Riches had their weight, as
well as reason, even before Sturges Bourne and his system of
plural voting, came to regulate and measure the powers of mammon
in local elections.&nbsp; But in every system of government, the
selfish rely on ignorance, more than on any other agent, for the
preservation of their powers.&nbsp; When the ignorant, however,
as well as the wise, were free to speak on local <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>affairs,
many unwelcome truths, which did not fall from the lips of the
ordained teachers, must have reached the ears of &ldquo;the
jobbers,&rdquo; within the walls of St. Katherine&rsquo;s, St.
James&rsquo;s, and St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The meetings of the
people, in these sainted places, for the transaction of their
parish business, were open to all the inhabitants of the parish;
and no local burden could be imposed without the sanction of the
majority.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that those who did not reside in
the parish, but who had determined to impose burdens on all those
who did, should call to their aid a power never before felt by
the people of Paddington: one, against which it was useless to
rebel; and from the <i>justice</i> of which there was no
appeal.</p>
<p>Private Act followed private Act, for the regulation of
property, over which the people saw and felt, <i>they</i> had no
control.&nbsp; And, when at length their voices were raised in no
measured cadence, some against this grievance, others against
that, the church was said to be desecrated, and polite ears could
no longer listen to such a babel of tongues.&nbsp; A gag was
provided.&nbsp; &ldquo;A select vestry&rdquo; was the instrument
used.&nbsp; And among the many unjust and unwise laws
&ldquo;passed, to keep down the people, from 1817 to 1820, the
most disgraceful era in our legislation,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Act for
the regulation of parish vestries,&rdquo; better known as
&ldquo;Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act,&rdquo; is to be found.&nbsp;
In this Act there are, without doubt, provisions which were much
required for the &ldquo;regulation of parish vestries;&rdquo; but
I have never yet heard any reason, worthy a moment&rsquo;s
consideration, for the introduction of the third clause into that
Act.&nbsp; This clause gives &ldquo;one vote and no more&rdquo;
to all persons rated for property &ldquo;not amounting to fifty
pounds,&rdquo; and adds one vote &ldquo;for twenty-five pounds of
annual rent, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;so, nevertheless,
that no inhabitant shall be entitled to give more than six
votes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principle, &ldquo;that property should be
properly represented,&rdquo; is thus absurdly carried out: all
those rated at &pound;50 per annum, have double the amount of
influence of those rated at &pound;49; while those rated at
&pound;500, have no more power in the local election, than those
rated at &pound;150.&nbsp; But to such miserable shifts as these
must legislation condescend, as soon as it swerves from the
eternal principles of justice.&nbsp; Is it not of as much concern
to the poor rate-payer, as to the rich, that the parish funds
shall be well expended?&nbsp; And who can shew that the wisdom of
a man can be measured by the size of his house; or by the amount
he contributes to the poor-rate?</p>
<p>On the fourth of April, 1820, the Rev. Dr. Crane, the Lord <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Bishop of
Exeter, and other influential inhabitants managed to establish
&ldquo;a select vestry&rdquo; in Paddington; in which they and
their friends had all the talk as well as all the work to
themselves.&nbsp; But if this select body prevented the people
talking, they prevented their eating also.&nbsp; The glorious
parish dinners, at which the parish officers and their friends
had rejoiced at the people&rsquo;s expense, were discontinued by
the bishop and his friends, in 1821; much to their credit be it
spoken, seeing that at the beginning of this year it was
discovered that there were no less than 824 persons in the parish
who claimed relief as paupers&mdash;more than one-eighth of the
whole population&mdash;and that out of these, thanks to the
cottages, there were 635 legally settled on the parish.</p>
<p>In May, 1821, a general meeting of the inhabitants was called
to consider, amongst various other things, the propriety of
petitioning the House of Commons for a general law, to regulate
the formation and maintenance of the highways on the north-west
side of the metropolis; and so much was such an Act required,
that it was resolved unanimously to petition.&nbsp; But when the
petition was read, and considered, it was found to be so
objectionable that it was as unanimously rejected.&nbsp; And by
the thirtieth of March, 1822, the inhabitants had seen quite
enough of the select vestry system; for on that day, when called
on to re-appoint it for another year, they would not do so.&nbsp;
But on the first of April, 1823, power was given to a committee
of rate-payers to procure a local Act.&nbsp; A draft-bill was
prepared by an experienced Parliamentary counsel, which was left
in the hands of the vestry-clerk, for the inspection of the
inhabitants; and it is said to have received &ldquo;their cordial
approbation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether that clause which has compelled
the people of Paddington, to elect their local governors, under
the system of plural votes, received their approbation, we are
not told; neither is it brought down to us by any authentic
record, how many read and digested an Act, which contains no less
than one hundred and fifty-five clauses, and occupies eighty
printed Act-of-Parliament-pages.&nbsp; Whether its provisions
were understood or not, however, the fifth of George the IV.,
chapter 126, received the sanction of the legislature on the
seventeenth of June, 1824, and since that date all the provisions
which have met with the approval of those who have been elected
under it, have been carried into effect.</p>
<p>The cost of procuring this Act, is said to have been
&pound;1,088 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>During these two years of select rule&mdash;from 1820
to 1822&mdash;the path had been paved for the introduction of
this local Act.&nbsp; A committee had been appointed early in
1822, to inquire into its expediency; spacious vestry premises
and other offices had been built on a portion of the garden
belonging to the alms-houses; and other preparations had been
made to effectually take the management of the local affairs out
of the hands of <i>the people</i>.</p>
<p>To find laws so comprehensive and wise, as not to require the
tinker at every little exigency, which may arise in every little
portion of the community, must surely be a proof of the wisdom of
a people.&nbsp; To find it necessary, constantly to alter general
laws; and constantly to be called on to &ldquo;stop gaps&rdquo;
by rotten bits of special legislation, which scarcely wear a
single session, must as surely betoken want of foresight in the
law-makers; or the approaching end of that system, which rests on
so sandy a foundation.&nbsp; Five and twenty Acts of Parliament,
at the least, have been passed specially to affect the property
and people of Paddington; and when we think of these, in
connection with the laws which apply to the people in general, we
may not be surprised to find, now and then, even a local
governor, elected under the aristocratic provisions of Sturges
Bourne&rsquo;s Act, lost amidst this heap of legislative
wisdom.</p>
<p>Local self-government, and local taxation, are questions of
the day; and are slowly, but surely, forcing themselves on the
consideration of those who have to direct the affairs of
&ldquo;an Empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Centralization, too, is under consideration; and, although in
the objectionable sense in which this idea is generally
understood, it has received the condemnation of the most acute
thinkers of the present and past time, still it is supported by
learned and powerful advocates, who profess to understand what
government really is or ought to be.&nbsp; In every sense these
subjects demand the attention of <i>the people</i>&mdash;not only
on account of the enormous revenue annually raised by local
taxation; but because all forms of government are in the
crucible, and it is desirable for the benefit of all, that the
best elements should be eliminated.</p>
<p>For the inhabitants of a particular parish or district to be
permitted to carry out a general law which has been enacted by a
whole people, according to the peculiar circumstances of their
local condition, is a very different thing from giving to that
district special privileges and laws, which may, and most <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>likely
would, become inimical to the public good.&nbsp; The
circumstances of almost every place in England have so
changed&mdash;not to say since their ancient municipal laws were
enacted, but within the last few years&mdash;that radical
alterations are absolutely demanded; and tinkering must soon
end.&nbsp; But the spirit of self-government, and the desire for
it, can never die, so long as the people understand the true
value of liberty.&nbsp; And no system of centralization for the
management of local affairs, can ever be rendered so palatable to
the people of England, as to induce them to endure it, till
mismanagement has attained a still higher point than it has yet
reached&mdash;a consummation many causes are now at work to
secure;&mdash;or till the people have greater power over the
actions of those who regulate the expenditure of the
country&mdash;a principle of justice which must ultimately
prevail.</p>
<p>That the whole of the people of Paddington, Marylebone, and
Pancras, (at the last census, upwards of 371,000 souls,) should
have but two &ldquo;places and voices,&rdquo; in the
Commons&rsquo; House of Parliament, while a few hundred in other
districts, have the same direct power over the legislative and
executive administration of this country, is so monstrous a
wrong, that some may imagine the people, who quietly submit to
such anomalies, have reached a point at which power may be safely
centred in a few hands.&nbsp; These are they, however, who do not
clearly discern the signs of the times.&nbsp; Any thing
resembling the tyranny of an absolute monarchy, or the despotism
of a well-paid and idle oligarchy, is as detestable now, as ever
it was to that people, who from their childhood are taught to
adore liberty for its own sake, as well as for the fruits it
brings forth.&nbsp; The Saxon people are patient, and endure
much; but to educate their children to look upon thraldom as
liberty, will never be permitted in England; and cannot much
longer be tolerated in other countries.</p>
<p>Till private legislation interested itself in the affairs of
the people of Paddington, the local government must have been of
the simplest kind.&nbsp; They had, indeed, little to trouble
themselves about on this score.&nbsp; Their church was provided
for, very badly, it is true, by those who took care of the
revenues which were given for its support; so that the
churchwardens were not troubled with the collection of
church-rates; and they had no archdeacon&rsquo;s visitations to
attend; so that no troublesome questions could be put to them by
this once useful and important officer of the church.&nbsp; The
overseer was equally unemployed; for at no time previous to the
latter part of the <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>last century, could there have been many poor.&nbsp;
The culture of the land, and its attendant duties, found
occupation and a living for all.&nbsp; Alms-houses for the aged
and infirm were built, as we have seen, in 1714; but no other
sort of poor-house was required; for the only idle people in the
parish were the few rich families, who were privileged to live on
the industry of others.</p>
<p>By the middle of the last century, nearly the whole of this
parish had become grazing-land.&nbsp; In 1795, according to
Lysons, there were upwards of eleven hundred acres of grassland
in Paddington; eighty four and a half acres only being arable, or
garden-ground.&nbsp; And for a long period, the people who
occupied the bishop&rsquo;s estate in Paddington, were as
celebrated for the quantity or quality of their milk, as they are
now for the number and size of their houses.&nbsp; One
persevering and handsome guardsman, who had contrived to gain the
good graces of a grazier&rsquo;s daughter, congregated cows here
to such an extent, that all London rang with the number.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nine hundred and ninety-nine&rdquo; could he keep, but the
black boggies always killed or ran away with his thousandth. <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; Whether these sprites were in
league with, or in any way connected with, &ldquo;Black
Meggie,&rdquo; who always lay in the cow-shed at the corner of
Tybourn Field, when not on duty, I cannot pretend to say.&nbsp; I
am informed by a gentleman who was born in this parish, and who
is no longer young in years, that he has heard the Tripod, which
is represented in Rocque&rsquo;s maps, as standing at the
junction of the Edgeware with the Uxbridge-road, was only placed
there when the good old English oracle had to execute her
judgments thereon.&nbsp; And that this &ldquo;three-legged
mare,&rdquo; Black Meggie by name, was only a poor temporary
substitute for the more ancient and formal &ldquo;Tybourn
Tree&rdquo; which had been cut down by some daring fellows the <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>night
before it was to have been put in requisition for the benefit of
a string of their friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tybourn tree&rdquo; had
been removed from its old quarters, as we have already seen, and
had been firmly erected, before Black Meggie&rsquo;s time, as one
of the institutions of the country, on that which is now the
Marylebone side of the Edgeware-road.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the last century, next to the beautiful
fields and quiet village, the gallows and the gibbet were the
principal attractions in Paddington.&nbsp; At the beginning of
this, &ldquo;Tomlin&rsquo;s New Town;&rdquo; the collection of
cottages, west of St. George&rsquo;s-row; a row of gardens, and a
large bowling-green, by the side of the Edgeware-road, between
Tybourn turnpike, and Paddington, were called into
existence.&nbsp; These changes, in conjunction with the grand
canal of Paddington, <a name="citation190"></a><a
href="#footnote190" class="citation">[190]</a> obliterated in a
few years the work of centuries; and succeeded not only in
altering the whole aspect of the place, but in infusing another
element of social life into the people.&nbsp; Lysons, writing in
1794, says &ldquo;this parish being chiefly church-land, there
has been but little increase of buildings till about four years
ago; since which time a number of small wooden cottages, to the
amount of nearly one hundred, have been erected a little north of
Tybourn turnpike.&nbsp; These cottages are let at from &pound;7
to &pound;12 per annum, and inhabited principally by journeymen
artificers who work in London, forming with their families a
small colony of about 600 persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the second edition of Lysons&rsquo; Work, published in
1811, he tells us these cottages were begun to be built in
1790.&nbsp; And he was informed by Mr. Pickering, the curate at
that time, that before the second census was taken, they had
increased to 600.</p>
<p>In Horwood&rsquo;s large and beautiful plan of London, dated
1799, we find that a part of this colony, that lot of cottages
built nearly opposite George-street, was called Tomlin&rsquo;s
New Town.&nbsp; We see, too, that St. George&rsquo;s row was
built at this time; that to the west of it a large building,
called Trafalgar, existed; and that another plot of land had been
covered with cottages.&nbsp; So that some portion of this colony
was added to <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>the people of Paddington, and these tenements to the
Tybourn Field, before the bishop&rsquo;s first Building Act, was
passed.&nbsp; Whether these wooden houses were built in
anticipation of that Act, by some one who had heard the tale of
the tinker, who lit his fire, and boiled his pot, and erected his
shed, all in one night, at the corner of old Church-street; and
who could not be dispossessed of that land which he had so
magically acquired; (a tradition which appears to have some
reference to the establishment of Paedings New Town,) or whether
these miserable sheds were built by the direction of the ground
landlords, to give them a telling argument in favour of their
private Act,&mdash;I cannot say.&nbsp; Both landlord and tenant,
however, found the power of a modern private Act of Parliament,
and the &ldquo;journeymen artificers&rdquo; had to &ldquo;move
on,&rdquo; in order that Connaught-terrace, and better houses for
the rich, might be built.&nbsp; The greater part of the enormous
increase in the population between 1801 and 1811, was caused by
the erection of these cottages, so very ill-suited for preserving
health and life.&nbsp; They were soon filled, however, by the
poorer class from the crowded parts of London; for pure air is
more relished by the poor, than that which is fetid and foul,
whatever the rich may say to the contrary.&nbsp; Give them but an
opportunity of getting it, and see how greedily it is embraced;
unless, indeed, the demoralizing effect of generations of bad
education is brought into operation, to counteract this natural
instinct.&nbsp; As fast as these cottages in the open fields were
built, they were occupied; although those who were to reap the
greater benefit of this more profitable occupation of the land,
had made no provision for effective drainage, security from cold
and wet, or for proper ventilation:&mdash;essentials, without
which all sanitary laws are put absolutely at defiance, however
well the situation of a town may be chosen, or however provident
the bountiful Giver of all good may have been in sending storms
and winds, to disperse the natural accumulation of unwholesome
gases in certain localities.</p>
<p>Messrs. Pulford and Erlam, two surveyors, in their report to
the vestry on the state of these cottages, in 1816, say,
&ldquo;we cannot refrain from thus recording our expression of
regret, that the ground-landlords should be so inordinate in
their demands.&nbsp; The effect of which is, the buildings are
ill-calculated to afford shelter from the inclemency of the
weather, and the want of drainage and consequent damp produce
disease, filth, and wretchedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, these
Paddington <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>cottages, which were for so many years so prominent a
feature in the parish, and which were so much sought after by the
poor, as a sort of country-retreat, were in fact, the generators
of &ldquo;disease, filth, and wretchedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the long winter-evenings, the muddy roads which led to
these cottages, were in total darkness, unless &ldquo;the parish
lantern&rdquo; chanced to offer its acceptable light; and there
is no doubt but that so long as these cottages remained they were
the hot-beds of fevers and ague.&nbsp; A gentleman, who was for
many years parish-surgeon, informs me that during the time these
cottages existed, he was rarely without cases of these diseases;
the latter disease was always endemic; and at times the former
put on a fearfully epidemic character.&nbsp; Still these detached
and semi-detached cottages on the Bishop&rsquo;s Estate were
better than the close streets of town, though these were more
than sufficiently unhealthy; but what cared those who profited by
this disease and misery, and their natural accompaniment, crime,
so long as their rents were paid?</p>
<p>The poor and the ignorant did not know &ldquo;the extent of
their misfortune;&rdquo; or if they did, the majority &ldquo;did
not seem to grumble at their lot, or to think it
hard.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a voice of complaint was occasionally
heard, the generous landlord said, &ldquo;it came from an
ill-conditioned, discontented wretch, whom it was useless to
attempt to satisfy; and the sooner he left the parish, the
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cries, indeed, from the feeble and the timid
went up to heaven for redress, and heaven alone was left to
answer them.</p>
<p>The ground-landlords, at length, seeing the cottages had
served their turn, made an attempt to remove this evil, by
clearing them away; and many a bitter curse was uttered by those
who were evicted; for in the simplicity of their dealings they
had made no legal provision for compensation for capital
invested; and, although some compensation was granted by the
Great Western Railway Company to the small tenants they
displaced, yet the ground-landlords did not follow their example;
and down to the present time, no dream of comfortable and
healthful lodgings for the poor on their estate, has even entered
their heads; no, not even the idea of a &ldquo;Thanksgiving
Building,&rdquo; so far as we know by any sign that has been
given.</p>
<p>Another source of disease and death was to be found on the
banks of the Paddington canal, which was opened with so much
<i>&eacute;clat</i>, on the 10th of July, 1801.&nbsp; No less
than 20,000 people came to Paddington, to hurrah the <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>mighty men
who so altered the aspect of this quiet village; and who, in
doing so, offered to the Londoner a new mode of transit for his
goods.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for the people of Paddington, on the
banks of this canal were stowed many other commodities than
&ldquo;dry goods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only the dust and ashes, but
the filth of half London were brought to &ldquo;that stinking
Paddington,&rdquo; (as it was now called,) for convenience of
removal.&nbsp; The time of removal was made to suit the
convenience of those who traded in these contaminating materials;
but the living sensitive nerves and active blood corpuscules of
the people who dwelt near its banks, were not considered.&nbsp;
And so, instead of having no doctor in the parish, as was the
case within the memory of many now living in it, both doctor and
sexton found full employ.</p>
<p>That this is no over-drawn picture of the condition of
Paddington for the first quarter of the present century, there is
plenty of evidence to prove.</p>
<p>The disbursements of churchwardens and overseers, in 1793, two
years before the passing of the Bishop&rsquo;s Building Act,
amounted to &pound;402 6<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>; but the
overseer&rsquo;s account alone, in 1815, amounted to &pound;3,375
12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; And although there were more to pay
the rates, still, even at the later date, many of the cottages
were not rated at all; and the greatest difficulty was
experienced in squeezing out of the hard earnings of the poor men
who occupied them, the small pittance (to them a great sum,)
which was at length obtained, towards defraying these serious
local charges.</p>
<p>In 1803, eight years after the Bishop&rsquo;s first Building
Act was obtained, the assessment of Paddington was &pound;9,966
10<i>s.</i> and the first poor-rate, levied under this
assessment, was one shilling and three-pence in the pound.&nbsp;
This valuation, however, was only one-third of the rental of 272
tenements; the smaller tenements not having been rated at
all.&nbsp; The overseers&rsquo; account, this year, amounted to
&pound;701 16<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; and it increased annually till
1811, when it was reported to the ratepayers at large, at their
annual meeting on Easter Tuesday, that the expenses of supporting
the poor have increased fourfold, in the last sixteen years.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the sensible inhabitants of Paddington,
who saw what the Bishop&rsquo;s Building Acts were doing for the
bishop and his lessees, and who felt, in a very tender point,
what they were doing for themselves as ratepayers, should be
anxious that those, who derived so much benefit from the parish,
should bear some share in the increased <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>expenses.&nbsp; But although all the expenses of the
church and the poor had been so considerately transferred from
the owners of the Paddington Estate, to the pockets of the
rate-payers; and although the additional claim of the poor was
excessive, yet it was not till the twenty-seventh of October,
1807, that the rate-payers in vestry assembled, &ldquo;resolved
that the Lord Bishop, in respect of the great tithes is rateable,
and that he be rated accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would have thought that the bishop, and his lessees,
knowing all this&mdash;knowing that the &ldquo;expenses of
supporting the poor, had increased fourfold in the last sixteen
years (that is, since the Act of 1795, during which time their
income from the land had increased, perhaps in a like proportion)
and that the same has arisen, in a great measure, from the
necessity of constant and casual relief to paupers residing in
small tenements built upon the Bishop of London&rsquo;s
Estate;&rdquo; knowing that they had received &pound;2,263
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, for land to increase the burial
ground,&mdash;a purchase made necessary principally on account of
this great increase in the number of paupers, and the conditions
under which they were placed: Knowing, I say, all these things;
for to not one could they have pleaded ignorance, it is barely
believeable that these legal protectors of the church and of the
poor should have refused this legal demand.&nbsp; Yet most
certainly they did so; and further, put the parishioners to the
unpleasant necessity of applying to a barrister, learned in the
law, for his opinion on this point.&nbsp; By the vestry minutes,
dated November 3rd, 1810, we find that Mr. Const,
&ldquo;<i>apprehends</i> the Lord Bishop <i>is</i> liable to the
poor-rate for the tithes both of the lands, belonging to the See,
in occupation of other persons, and those for which a composition
is received.&rdquo;&nbsp; And accordingly in January, 1811, the
Bishop of London is rated in the new assessment made that year,
upon &pound;462, the estimated annual value of the great
tithes.</p>
<p>As the land became more valuable, this burdensome charge could
not be endured.&nbsp; The agents of the bishop advise
&ldquo;merging,&rdquo; and &ldquo;commutation;&rdquo; and, after
the performance of these feats, on the twenty-third of July,
1844, the vestry receive a letter from Messrs. Budd and Hayes,
informing them, &ldquo;the Tithes of the Paddington Estate have
been <i>merged</i>, and that the rent-charge for the tithes of
the rest of the parish is &pound;166 13<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; And they considerately mention this,
&ldquo;in order that the future rates may be assessed with
reference to that sum, <i>after making proper deductions</i>, and
not on the amount they have been hitherto assessed
upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Whereupon the <i>poor</i> bishop and his lessees are
relieved from some of the <i>great</i> charges laid on them, for
the support of the poor; the vestry resolving to assess
&ldquo;the tithes of the Paddington Estate in future, at
&pound;166, instead of &pound;340, as heretofore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of 1810, it was found that out of a rental of
&pound;5,200 paid by the cottagers, only &pound;535 of this was
rated to the poor; and that the average of all the assessments in
the parish, was but two-thirds of the real value; some being
rated at one-third, others at one-half, and others at
five-twelfths of the full value.&nbsp; The value of the property,
as assessed in 1811, was &pound;28,597, the assessment having
been taken on 865 separate tenements.</p>
<p>From the census of this year, 1811, I find that 4,609 persons
then living in the parish, constituted 1,083 families, occupying
879 houses.&nbsp; In 1812, out of 935 dwelling-houses, only 393
were rated to the poor; &ldquo;the rest being miserable huts,
occupied by paupers and very poor people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1821 there were 1,448 families in Paddington, four of whom
are returned in the census of that year as being
agricultural.&nbsp; In the same year there were 824 persons
claiming relief as paupers; and the sum of &pound;37 7<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i> was paid weekly for out-door and casual relief.</p>
<p>In 1825 the assessment of this parish was &pound;46,245
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; and in 1831 it had increased to
&pound;71,528 18<i>s.</i>&nbsp; The rates levied in the former
year, amounted to &pound;6,025 10<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i>; in
the latter, to &pound;14,691 16<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
The number of families, according to the census of 1831, was
3,493.&nbsp; In 1841 Paddington was in union with Kensington,
Hammersmith, and Fulham, and I find the average of the
establishment charges for three years for Paddington, set down at
&pound;2,712.</p>
<p>The transition-state from an agricultural village to the
fashionable Tyburnia, was no very agreeable time for the majority
of those who lived in Paddington.&nbsp; When the cottages were
swept away, and the heavy poor-rates which they had entailed,
were diminished, new burdens sprang up, scarcely less
grievous.&nbsp; Rents became enormous; the Highway, Watching, and
Lighting rates were excessive; and these were rendered more
oppressive on account of those, who received the greatest benefit
from the causes which necessitated the greater expenditure, not
bearing their just share of this local taxation.&nbsp; And yet
the local Act had made some sort of provision for an equitable
adjustment of these expenses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, for the majority of the rate-payers,
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the
election of those, who had to carry into execution the provisions
of that Act, viz., the election of vestrymen, was not in their
hands.&nbsp; That clause of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act, which
gave four votes to those who were rated at &pound;100; five votes
to those who were rated at &pound;125; and six votes to all those
rated at &pound;150; placed the election in the hands of the
minority; and, as that minority was much more interested in the
success of the building-speculations which were in progress, than
in that just and wise economy, which was advantageous to the
majority of the rate-payers, one of the most important clauses in
the local Act, was for years, and still is, disregarded.&nbsp;
This, the 132nd clause of that Act, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And whereas it has happened and may happen
that Houses and other Buildings within the said Parish have been
or may be began to be built, but not finished nor let, and it is
reasonable that such Houses and Buildings should be rated and
assessed for the Purposes of paving, watching, and lighting; be
it therefore further enacted, That until such Houses or other
Buildings which now are or hereafter may be built or in building
shall be finished and tenanted, (if the Street, Square, Lane, or
other Place wherein such House or other Building is or shall be
situated shall be paved, repaired, cleansed, and lighted by
virtue and in pursuance of this Act,) it shall and may be lawful
<a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a> to and for the said Vestry to rate and
assess all such Houses and other Buildings situate within the
said Parish as are or shall be erected and covered in, but not
finished nor let, either by One or more distinct Assessment or
Assessments, or by including them in any other Assessment or
Assessments, at a Rate not exceeding Sixpence for every Square
Yard of Ground paved or to be paved belonging to or lying before
the Fronts or Sides of such Houses or other Buildings, and in
like Manner and for the like Purposes to rate and assess all such
Houses or other Buildings as last mentioned which are or shall be
erected but not covered in, at a Rate not exceeding Four-pence
for every Square Yard of Ground paved or to be paved by virtue of
this Act, and belonging to or lying before the Fronts or Sides of
such Houses or other Buildings, until the same shall be covered
in, as aforesaid, and then at a Rate not exceeding Four-pence for
<a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>every
Square Yard until the same shall be let or occupied; which
last-mentioned Rates or Assessments shall be paid by and
recoverable from the Proprietor or Proprietors, Lessee or
Lessees, Owner or Owners of such House or Houses, Building or
Buildings respectively, and shall be charged and changeable on
the said Premises; and if the said Owner or Owners, Proprietor or
Proprietors, Lessee or Lessees, shall refuse or neglect to pay
the same, upon Demand, then and in every such Case such Rate or
Rates, Assessment or Assessments, and all Arrears due thereon,
shall and may be levied on the Goods and Chattels of the Person
or Persons so required to pay the same in manner herein directed;
and in case the Owner or Owners, Proprietor or Proprietors,
Lessee or Lessees of such House or Houses, Building or Buildings,
shall not be known or cannot be found, then the said Rate or
Rates, Assessment or Assessments made thereon, shall be and
remain charged and chargeable on the said Premises until the
Owner or Owners, Proprietor or Proprietors, Lessee or Lessees,
can be found, and the same may at any Time be levied and
recovered upon the said Premises in like Manner as other Rates
made by virtue of this Act are made recoverable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four years ago, this <i>forgotten</i> clause of the local Act
was introduced to the notice of the vestry.&nbsp; It was admitted
that it had not been observed; and the Builders, who formed the
most influential party in the vestry, thought it would be
<i>unfair</i> to enforce it.&nbsp; A little ventilation of this
subject, however, induced the majority of another vestry to
believe, and to resolve, &ldquo;that all the rateable property in
the parish should be rated.&rdquo;&nbsp; But so much power have
the Builders and the Proprietors of the soil in the vestry, that
this good resolution has been from time to time set aside; and
down to the present moment, the rate-payers at large have
received no benefit from it.&nbsp; So that, although the Vestry
Minute-books are crammed with applications to the vestry, to take
under their protection, streets, squares, &amp;c., and although
the taking thereto has increased the local taxation very
considerably, and will do so, year by year; yet none but the old
inhabitants and the in-coming tenants have been taxed for all the
wear and tear of old roads, caused by drawing building materials
over them, and for all the additional expenses in watching and
lighting, which every new house entails on the parish.</p>
<p>If this tax had been levied from the passing of the Act, in
1824, down to the present time, it would have saved the
rate-payers some thousands of pounds; and it would have <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>fallen on
those who have received the most substantial benefits from the
parish, although they have paid the least towards the local
taxation, viz., the Bishop of London, and the lessees of the
Paddington Estate.&nbsp; Had this clause been in force, those who
took the land for building on, would have pointed out this
charge, and insisted on its due consideration.&nbsp; For this
additional burden, then, as well as for the enormous poor-rate
entailed by the miserable cottages, the dwellers on the
Paddington Estate are, in truth, indebted to their old friends,
&ldquo;the lords of the soil,&rdquo; as much as to their local
governors, and the builders.</p>
<p>And this is not the only burden, connected with the roads,
which the owners of the Paddington Estate have attempted to throw
on the people of Paddington.</p>
<p>In 1828, and 1829, when the Grand Junction-road, which had
been recently made, was in a miserable condition; when it was
ascertained that it would cost &pound;400 a-year to keep it in
repair; and when only &pound;7 were the amount of rate received
by the parish from the inhabitants of Oxford and Cambridge
terraces; the owners of the soil tried, by force of law, to
compel the vestry to appoint a surveyor to inspect this road, and
take upon them the charge of its repair.&nbsp; The trial,
however, went against them, and the learned Lord Tenderden
delivered an elaborate judgment in favour of the parishioners. <a
name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a></p>
<p>But what the law would not compel the vestry to do, the vestry
could voluntarily do; and, as the election of vestrymen was
virtually in the hands of a few builders and proprietors, these
few took especial care to elect those, and those only, whose
interests coincided with their own.&nbsp; Thus, those who were
most deeply interested <i>in the Paddington Estate</i>, became
the governors <i>of the parish</i>; and, as these personal
interests were very frequently antagonistic to the interests of
the ratepayers at large the public weal has had to suffer; and
&ldquo;parish squabbles&rdquo; have not been unknown in
Paddington, even since the introduction of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s
Act.&nbsp; And discontent must continually arise, so long as the
majority of the ratepayers know they are not fairly represented;
that they have a minority of votes in the election of their local
governors; and that the business of the parish is conducted with
closed doors.&nbsp; Although this injustice was made legal, at
the time when Grattan and old Sarum sent Members to Parliament;
and when <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>a single nobleman had more influence in law-making,
than the whole of the inhabitants of the largest cities, yet
&ldquo;An Act for the better Regulation of Vestries, and for the
appointment of Auditors of accounts, in certain parishes of
England and Wales,&rdquo;&mdash;the first and second William
IVth, chapter 60,&mdash;better known as Hobhouse&rsquo;s Act, was
passed by the reformers, even before the Parliament itself was
reformed.</p>
<p>This Act <i>for the better regulation of vestries</i> gives
one vote, and one vote only, to each rate-payer; and it is
scarcely believeable, that so just a principle could be refused
to any parish, which had become too numerous to continue the
&ldquo;good old English constitutional custom&rdquo; of personal
attendance in Vestry; where and when each individual rate-payer
might express his opinions on any subject within its
jurisdiction, and record his vote thereon.&nbsp; Yet it has been
most strenuously opposed, from its introduction into Parliament
down to the present time, by the vestry of Paddington; and in
consequence of its being necessary to obtain the sanction of
two-thirds of the rate-payers who vote, and half those who are
qualified to vote, before this Act can be adopted, the attempt to
introduce it into this parish has twice failed.&nbsp; In 1849,
there was a considerable majority for its adoption, but not the
requisite proportion; and in 1853, it is said, the half of the
qualified rate-payers have not voted.&nbsp; So that at the
present time, Paddington enjoys the unenviable distinction of
being behind its neighbours in the adoption of a liberal policy
in the election of those to whom are entrusted its local affairs;
and those who conduct them, have the unenviable honour of being
the representatives of a section only of their
fellow-parishioners.</p>
<p>Even the ancient rule of electing churchwardens, by single
votes, has been set aside in Paddington; the Judges of the
Exchequor Court sanctioning this proceeding, when the vestry
appealed to that Court, by writ of error, from the decision of
the learned Lord Chief Justice Denman, who had confirmed to the
inhabitants of this place, their ancient right in this
particular: <a name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a> a right, which every inhabitant, who
was not a lawyer, must have believed, as that learned Judge did,
the tenth clause of the local Act confirmed to him.&nbsp; This
clause declares that the election of vestrymen shall not take
place, until after the usual election of churchwardens;
&ldquo;which election of churchwardens shall take place on
<i>Easter Tuesday</i>, <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>and be conducted from year to year
in such manner, as hath been usual in the same parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rule of plural voting for vestrymen having been
established by the adoption of Sturges Bourne&rsquo;s Act,
vestrymen so elected could not sanction the election of
church-wardens in the manner which had been usual in the parish;
viz.&mdash;by show of hands.&nbsp; Those gentlemen, who still
govern Paddington, determined to take advantage of a legal
quibble, to abrogate the ancient form of election; but their
proceedings produced an amount of ill-feeling, which lasted for
years, between those who now really had the election of parish
officers in their hands, and those who, in consequence of the
introduction of this new principle, had nothing to do with
parochial affairs, except the payment of whatever sums of money
were demanded.&nbsp; This feeling is indeed not yet allayed;
neither can it be till this act of injustice to the majority, is
for ever and entirely revoked.&nbsp; And justice must not long be
delayed, if harmony is to be restored.&nbsp; Upwards of 2,000
rate-payers have this year voted in favour of that Act, which
gives a single vote, and but one vote in local elections; and it
behoves all who pay towards the local expenses, all who are
interested in the welfare of this parish, to think of this, and
to co-operate by every means in their power, for the
establishment of good government on the solid basis of just
principles.&nbsp; When this is done, all discord may cease; for
it will then be the fault of the majority if Paddington is badly
governed.</p>

&ldquo;The water of Tyburne running to the Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote10b"></a><a href="#citation10b"
class="footnote">[10b]</a>&nbsp; The charter of this king,
besides securing to the Abbey the manor of Chelsea, which
Thurstan is said to have given the monks&mdash;&ldquo;granted
them moreover, exemption from toll, and every third tree, with a
third of the fruit growing in his wood at
Kyngesbrig&rdquo;&mdash;vide Lysons.&nbsp; This wood I take to
have been that portion of Middlesex forest which belonged to the
crown, called in other documents Kingsholt.&nbsp; I think the
situation of this wood is sufficiently indicated in this charter,
viz. at Kingsbridge&mdash;the bridge which carried the
king&rsquo;s road over the Tybourn.&nbsp; That portion of
Kensington gardens which was considered part of the manor of
Knightsbridge, and which is still in Paddington parish, I take to
have been a portion of the king&rsquo;s wood, and a district west
of the Tybourn, and south of the Uxbridge road&mdash;the
king&rsquo;s highway&mdash;I consider was also styled
Kingsbridge: Knightsbridge being a much more modern appellation,
and not used till after the Wycombe road was made and a bridge
built by some worthy knight over the Tybourn at this part of its
course.</p>
<p>But it has been imagined that a considerable portion of the
parish of Paddington formed part of the ancient manor of
Chelsea.&nbsp; And it is a fact that a piece of land, one hundred
and thirty-seven and three quarter acres in extent, is now
claimed by Chelsea as part and parcel of their parish, although
it is two miles from any other portion of that parish; and,
although, as I shall hereafter produce evidence to prove, it has
been considered a part of Paddington.</p>
<p>Further, we find that &ldquo;Robert de Heyle, in 1368, leased
the whole of his manor of Chelchith, <i>except Westbourn and
Kingsholt</i>, to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster for the
term of his own life,&rdquo; upon condition that he was allowed
to live in a certain house in the Convent; that he was provided
with a robe of esquires&rsquo; silk, and twenty pounds yearly;
and daily with two white loaves, and two flagons of

documents sadly damaged the numerous stories told about these
fields, &ldquo;Chelsea Reach,&rdquo; as they are called, the
least I can do will be to attempt to preserve two of those I have
heard.&nbsp; Supposing the second to have any truth in it, the
first will shew how the people may be kept in ignorance by the
use of words which have a double meaning&mdash;how the ignorant
may be kept in ignorance by telling them a story which they are
to read one way, and that according to the common acceptation,
while the knowing ones, the fraternity who have become
philosophers, and have been admitted into the secret, may read,
it in another.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Chelsea Pensioner having been to visit a
poor lame grandchild who was being educated in good and sound
learning at the Free School, established by John Lyon, at
Harrow-on-the-hill, was so much delighted with his visit, that to
celebrate the occasion in a proper manner he drank to the memory
of the generous founder a little too often and a little too
deep.&nbsp; The ale continued to affect his upper story till he
passed the seventh mile stone, (and it must be known that the
mile stones on this road were numbered from Harrow, and not as on
every other road from London,) mistaking a white line of water,
the Paddington Canal, for the road, at this point, he found, when
it was too late, that a man was not destined by his Maker to walk
on that element; his <i>corps</i> was not found for some
days.&nbsp; When it was discovered no one would own it; and what
was worse no one would bury it, till at length it became
necessary for the civil magistrate to interfere; he sent for the
Chelsea clergyman, directed him to read the proper service, and
bury the corps where it was lying.&nbsp; Before the clergyman
consented to do this, however, he insisted that it should be
carried round a certain number of fields which he pointed
out.&nbsp; That magic circle constitutes this dry &ldquo;Chelsea
Reach;&rdquo; and within it, and in consequence of this incident,
the Chelsea Rector always claims tithe over it.&nbsp; Beneath the
piece of ground not claimed by either parish the corps lies
buried.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, as any story-maker will readily perceive, is a sad
hodge-podge.&nbsp; But this is the story for the ignorant,
perhaps made by them.&nbsp; The knowing ones have their simple
story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A certain prebend, of a certain Cathedral,
seeing this land without an owner kindly took it under his
care.&nbsp; It became his <i>corps</i>.&nbsp; He grew birches on
it for the boys in his school; and when his occupation was gone,
his relatives claimed the land as his freehold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether there is any, and if any, what amount of truth in
either of these stories, I must leave the reader to
discover.&nbsp; A key, perhaps, may be found to the latter in
another story which is told of the purchase of this land of the
descendants of Dr. Busby, and by the fact of a Dr. Busby having
held the prebendal corps of Boxgrave, which was situated in
Westborne <i>in the County of Sussex</i>.</p>
<p>It would appear that these closes, &ldquo;containing by
estimation fifty acres,&rdquo; were all that remained in
Paddington of the Old Chelsea Manor: but as we have already seen
137&frac34; acres are now claimed by Chelsea as belonging to that
parish.</p>

as I have before observed, ministers were appointed by the Crown,
to take and keep the accounts of all monies derived from the
lands which had belonged to religious houses.&nbsp; Many of these
ministers accounts are still preserved and contain much valuable
information.&nbsp; According to these accounts (vide
<i>Monsticion Anglicanum</i>, vol. i. p. 326&ndash;27) it would
appear that for the first year the Crown received only &pound;31
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> from the church lands in Paddington, and
for the next year the same sum with the addition of 2<i>s.</i>
rent charge, for the conducion of water; but in the 36th and 37th
of Henry the VIII., I find the minister returns the Crown Rent of
this manor and rectory, at &pound;41 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>
<p><a name="footnote45"></a><a href="#citation45"
class="footnote">[45]</a>&nbsp; Henry the VIII, finding that the
clergy readily paid the first fruits of their livings to the
Pope, and that &pound;160,000 had been transmitted to Rome, on
account of this claim, since the second year of Henry the
seventh, thought, very naturally, as he had been proclaimed
&ldquo;The supreme head of the church and clergy of England, in
so far as is permitted by the law of Christ,&rdquo; that he ought
to stand in the Popes&rsquo;s shoes in this particular also; and
that the annates, or first fruits, ought to be paid to the Crown
of England, instead of going to enrich a Foreign Potentate.&nbsp;
He first reduced the payment to five per cent. &ldquo;the better
to keep the Pope in awe,&rdquo; but finding that remedy
unsuccessful took the whole to himself.&mdash;Vide

produced it, see <i>The Builder</i>, for 1846, pages
589&ndash;615.</p>
<p>There is an error in a previous notice of this church in the
Builder, Vol. IV., page 395, which may have led to the belief,
that it did not much concern the rate-payers of Paddington, how
it was built; the printer of this notice having made the church
commissioners give ten thousand pounds, instead of one
thousand&mdash;the actual amount given.</p>

did not save the parish the payment of &ldquo;&pound;38 for a
carved oak altar table and two chairs, supplied at

great importance; the wood having carried it in this

<p><a name="footnote156"></a><a href="#citation156"
class="footnote">[156]</a>&nbsp; It must not be imagined that
this vestry represented the majority of rate-payers; for it did
no such thing.&nbsp; At the annual public meeting of rate-payers,
which was held after these great outlays for the church had been
incurred, the names of the parish officers who sanctioned these
proceedings were received with the most unmistakeable marks of
disapprobation; and at an election, which virtually tried the
management of the whole body, a great majority of the rate-payers
voted against the vestry.&nbsp; Moreover, I am of opinion, after
the most careful and impartial investigation of this subject,
that the <i>bona fide</i> government of this parish is, and has
been for years, in the hands of the bishop and his lessees,
(through their agents in the parish,) and a few builders.</p>

Hyde-park, are within an easy distance of Paddington, it is true;
and the people see the necessity of maintaining those true lungs
of London; so that these open spaces are not likely to be covered
by the mason.&nbsp; But these Royal Parks are kept for the
promenades of those who can afford to ride on horses or in
carriages, or who, if walking, can afford to dress well; these
therefore do not make up for the loss of the old
village-green.</p>

fifty-five persons to ten houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; But many causes
would combine to make the families in a village less numerous

of five and a half, in the computations I have made for the
population of Paddington.</p>

engraved copper-plate, in memory of Henry Kenwricke, citizen and

class="footnote">[189]</a>&nbsp; This story was told of several
cowkeepers in the neighbourhood of London; and an old, and oft
repeated tale, is told of one of this grazier&rsquo;s
workmen.&nbsp; The young man who married the heiress, turned out
a terrible old miser, and his penurious habits, as a matter of
course, made him no great favourite with those whom he employed;
therefore his final exit from this world was not much regretted
by them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty Johnny,&rdquo; the Guardsman&rsquo;s
son, was not of the same turn of mind as his father, and his
failings and faults were looked on with a more lenient eye by the
people.&nbsp; What the father had saved with so much care, the
son delighted to spend; and after the old gentleman&rsquo;s
death, the magic number of live stock soon vanished from the
fields.&nbsp; A few cows were sold to supply any immediate want;
and after a greater demand on one occasion, than ordinary, Pretty
Johnny was not in the best of tempers.&nbsp; This lazy old
fellow, who had by some chance found out for what purpose the
cows were sold, happened to cross his path at this unlucky
moment, and the grazier who saw the wicked twinkle in the
fellow&rsquo;s eye, swore, if he did&rsquo;nt get out of the way
and go on with his work, he would send him to the
devil.&mdash;The countryman nothing daunted, quietly rejoined,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not, master; for if you do, I&rsquo;ll
tell daddy you&rsquo;ve sold the cows.&rdquo;</p>

would be nothing to make the canal of Venice, more poetical than
that of Paddington, were it not for its artificial
adjuncts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vide Cunningham&rsquo;s Hand-book.&nbsp;
The artificial adjuncts of the Paddington Canal, from its first
formation to the present time, have been any thing but
poetical.&nbsp; It is true an imaginative Cockney might, in snowy
weather, have imbibed his notion of the Alps from what he then
saw on the banks of this canal; for immense heaps of dust and
ashes towered high above the house-tops; and these artificial
mountains are said to have been worth ten thousand pounds
a-piece.</p>

relieve themselves of the charge of <i>all Empty Rates</i>) to
the effect that these words, &ldquo;it shall and may be

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
